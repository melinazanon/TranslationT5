Schools are getting more and more focused on math, law and grammar.
In class on English literature, students should at least read a piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, modern lyric and contemporary British novels from 1914.
In the exam, you'll also find "unread texts" to help you read more broadly.
The combined course of English literature and language is being scrapped.
From 2015, pupils must be able to take an independent GCSE exam, though there's a strong argument for choosing English as a separate qualification.
The education ministry will publish the new curriculum vitae for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that were radicalized.
Other kernels will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the inspector general for examinations, will announce a new organisation of the GCSE syllabuses, as well as a new syllabus and less course work.
In a speech in summer, education minister Michael Gove said there is a wide consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore trust in the public, while he stressed that the GCSEs would become more demanding, ambitious and stricter.
Studies show that in English schools there is less time for maths homework – 116 hours a year or three hours a week during the school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast, teachers in Australian schools average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore 138.
While there won't be a formal demand for teachers to spend more time on maths in class, the co-ordinators say the extensive math exam – combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject – will probably encourage schools to put more hours on it.
In the course syllabus, more attention will be paid to "Problems from a right life", including finance.
Vergewaltiger in South Africa: twice a life in Haft.
Nine months after the brutal beating and murder of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the prosecutor sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday.
That was reported by SABC.
The victim died later from the severe injuries.
John Kana had already been arrested for murder at the beginning of the week.
The act had spread across the country.
The 21-year-old then had Anene Booysen in February in a factory in Bredasdorp near Kapstadt.
The doctors fought for 14 hours to save the lives of the victims, but that was not enough.
The look on the teenagers was so disgraceful that the carer and the counselor needed psychological help.
Kana admitted during the process that she had been drinking in a bar at night.
He confessed to killing her, but he insists that he is responsible for the death of the girl.
At first several thugs were outraged, but two suspects were released from prison because the evidence against them wasn't enough.
Even the state attorney during the process said she was convinced that Kana was at the time of the attack by herself.
Violence is almost universal in South Africa: there are about 64 000 reports of violence in the past.
That's almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it's way more than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the Dunkelziffer when it comes to sexual violence but the 10- to 25-fold.
A small town in a new-foundland town considers Burt Muro a loveable place because he took part in a race in the United States in 1920 by his motorbike.
In spite of a heart attack, Burt isn't able to carry out his dream.
With his inheritance, a couple of spares and a hypothec on his old workshop pen, he set sail for Los Angeles by sea.
After the movie, there's coffee, tea and cake.
Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in touch.
The trade on the Nasdaq option market was suspended on Friday afternoon.
In a meeting, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US-OPCs, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, closed their business unharmed.
The latest incident involves a whole series of smaller and larger paddles on the Brahms River.
The Nasdaq indexes were not computed until Tuesday because there were errors in the transmission of data.
In August this year, two pancakes were given in a week by one person.
In response to technical problems, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs issued a massively flawed buy order on the option market.
That's why the clerks needed almost a whole day to process the orders and deliver them.
Two days later, half the entire stock market in the United States was collapsed because of a computer program on the Nasdaq exchange for several hours.
For the record, Facebook banned users from posting on Facebook last year.
The Nasdaq systems were not able to cope with the demand for goods and services, so later the SEC issued a notice of intent and the company received a response of 10 million dollars.
Spies like Edward Snowden are generally ready for a conversation with the German authorities.
Nevertheless, he wants to know about his situation.
In a non-solicited letter, the former U.S. Army intelligence officer Hans-Christian Ströbele announced that he was looking for former NSA agents after a meeting with Snowden and then went to the governor's, state and general assembly.
The writing has the following wordlaut, derived from a commonly used translation: "Standard."
At the other end of the fence.
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
Edward Joseph Snowden was employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in the United States.
During my employment in these institutions, I was subjected to systemic sanctions against my government which made me accountable for my actions morally.
As a result of this reflection, I saw a hard-working and impatient heart that forced me to abandon my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying the asyl granted to me by the international treaty.
I'm encouraged by the resonance in my political action, both in the USA and elsewhere.
In the whole world, and especially in the United States, there are protests against a system of universal surveillance that no one accuses of being a service to the public.
These spying scandals brought about a lot of proposals for new legislations and directives that targeted the once disgraced public trust.
The benefit of these gained knowledge for the society is becoming clearer; while the proceeds from selling were evidently reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was evidently positive, my government discourse is treated as if it were to be a trial and proves to criticise political opinion and expose it under attack.
Dennoch, telling the truth is not a crime.
I'm sure that the government of the United States will be able to provide this necessary relief with the help of the international community.
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation arise, I'll be able to make myself heard in the constructive disclosure of the facts presented in the media, particularly in regard to truth and authority of the reports, accurately and lawfully.
I look forward to speaking with you in your country as soon as the situation is settled and thank you for your efforts to keep the international law that we all protect.
Edward Snowden is confirmed by Hans-Christian Ströbbele.

Drama in Uruguay: Young boys killed game monkeys with machetes.
Two children in Uruguay murdered an 11-year-old.
The 14 and 12 year old boys had invited their victims to go hunting with them.
With knives and saws, they gathered only on Tuesday the 11-year-old and warmed the lamb in a fire, reported the newspaper "El Pas" on Thursday.
After they had played football in a work zone before their apartments.
The leichnam was found the following night in Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres from the exclusive beach of Punta del Este.
Alibi, when she was supposed to take care of a five-year-old half-sister of the young girls she took with her, said that she was sexually assaulted by the boy.
When the girl, in front of the police without arrest, described the attack on her as a racist attack on the 11-year-old.
As a result, the older players created a rivalry in the football game.
He was put in a mental health centre at the time.
Israeli government confirms no attack on Syrian airbase.
A US government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed that Israeli fighter jets had attacked a Syrian airbase a day before.
The aim was to be a "religious outrage", as the Israeli government claimed they had been against the Palestinian Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Libyan media and the Arab news agency Al-Arab had previously reported that the port of Latakia was shot on Thursday night, and the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the front lines in Latakia, showing the shells of the Russian offensive rifles Typ S-125 Newa and a battery from SA-3 rockets that were capable of carrying out a range of 35 kilometers and launching missiles up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government didn't officially confirm the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quoted an anonymous Israeli government official saying that he thought Israel had carried out the attack, but wasn't sure.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli ministry of defense said: "We don't come to these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai told the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground-level rockets to Hbollah before it had been successful.
The Israeli government had again warned that any attempt by Syrians to threaten the Holocaust with chemical weapons or other dangerous weapons would spark a "red line", which would lead to a military response.
Take a walk through mud, woods and thorns for free medical care.
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical help to homeless people in Kamerun.
Bwell and his team spend almost every weekend treating dogs from patients.
There aren't many doctors in the west African country, there is only one for 5,000 people.
Choose here or with your mobile device.
Dr. George Bwelle is among the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other men in the top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year."
The winner receives 250.000 dollar for his extraordinary work.
Twenty years ago, George's brother watched as his sick father lost consciousness and went to hospitals that didn't have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwell was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Kamerun.
Not only had he got a broken arm, but then formed a reaction that spread throughout his brain, and there a substance that should be injected into him for the rest of his life.
There were no neurosurgeons in Kamerun, George Bwell said.
We would have brought him out of Kamerun if we had had had the money.
It took a lot of years for his father to accompany him to the hospitals and clinics to get the treatment they needed to give them.
"It's not easy," said Bwell.
You can leave the house at five a.m. and go to the hospital to be the first one, but not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since her father died in 2002.
There's only one doctor in Kamerun for about 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio of doctors in the United States is 413 people.
But even if a doctor were to prescribe for her, most patients couldn't afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the health services in the country are private.
The only problem they have is anger, says Bwell.
And the devil makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen decided to do something about it.
George Bwelle and his team have carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor and worked as a surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
Aside from that, he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to remote regions on weekends offering free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people gather in minibuses and take the medical evacuation to the scene of the disaster, where help is needed.
Nothing ever goes unnoticed.
For more than once, they had to clear the vehicles of mud and flies.
But when they arrive, they'll be treated like heroes: a festival, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In this desert, free medical care is really a reason for celebration and well-being – with his wide smile and endless energy – is often enjoyed at a happy party.
The following morning, the team will begin an investigation of dogs by patients.
"We're going to take care of 500 people on the way."
They come from a radius of 60 km around the village and walk.
Each of these weekly clinics offers medical care in a variety of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, pneumonia and other serious diseases.
Others get dresses, goggles or free birth certificates – documents that are needed for school, but many poor families can't afford it.
In the evenings, the team performs simple operations with a loud bang.
Operations usually take place in a school, the council house or an apartment; after surgery, the patients get up and go to the rest room to have a rest for the next one.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection programme is going to be provided by the generator of the group, working bulbs and his volunteers until the early hours of Sunday.
It's a tough subject, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
You're sleeping all night so we can stay awake and finish our work, says Bwell.
The team goes back to town on Sunday, tired but proud of the work they've done.
The group – a mix of local doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that they make a huge difference to the people they help.
A man explained that the free operation of a hangover made him able to work again.
That changes my family's future, said the man.
Apart from working as a nurse at the hospital, nurses also work in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he pays 60 % of his general salary, while the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and volunteering to work in the Bwales Group.
Either he's in hospital or he's trying to raise money for the organisation so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe, and Bwell support them, it's a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
We can help with operations where we help to remove blood or keep instruments for Dr. Barrow, says O'Malley.
It would never be possible to become a medical student in the second year in America.
The students usually pay their way to Kamerun themselves and often bring some expensive medical supplies.
But just once in Yaoundé, Bwell takes care of the transport, the transport and the instruction.
He is without doubt a hero, says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the kamerun people knows no limits.
A steady job isn't a burden for bums.
To live a happy life and to fulfill a promise he made to his father is a great pleasure.
I'm so happy when I do this work, my boss says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laughter and to ease the pain.

Father Francis calls the first carnivore in February.
Papa Francis will be the first to call a new cathedral on February 22nd, as the Vatikan did on Christmas Day.
Carnelians are the tallest choirs in the catholic church following the pap, and they are also the first to choose a pope so that Franziskus will become the first group of men to take part in the final election of his successors.
There are 201 cathedrals at the moment.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can't vote in the primary election – which makes up a group of 120 "wahlberechtigte cardinals".
In an explanation given in the news, Pater Federico Lombardi, a spokesperson for the Vatican, said that a meeting of the clergy will be held to discuss the new constitution, as well as being known as the Council of Rome.
Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to join the council of bishops in February, so that other meetings which will demand the participation of Catholics from around the world can be held, said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of electorate seats will probably be down by February.
He explained that a pamphlet usually contains as many carnations as possible so that the number of electorate carnilets can be counted again 120, and as many carnilets over 80 as he wishes.
The outlook for the next year is bleak because it's the first time since the election of Franziskus in March this year that it's so Valero.
At the moment, there's a certain overlap between Europe and Italy.
It'll be interesting to see if the new papaya from around the world will be renewed to bring back the balance, he said.
Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, but only a small number of Catholics live there.
The cathedrals will be the first to be called, after the formation of the Council of Cardinals in France, a group of eight cathedrals from around the world are set to have the task of finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the papal family decided everything by themselves.
No one selected these eight countries that should help him, said Valero.
He said it was "good possibility" that Franziskus would like to consult the Cardinals.
But we weren't in a position before – it's all totally new.
Valero said that typical bears would call carnivores from large places, but stewards of French are "full surprises – we know not who he is calling".
Worker killed by boss: seriously injured.
A malfunctioning electrical fence killed a 51-year worker in Eggelsberg on Thursday and injured himself badly.
A man from Lamprechthausen wanted to exchange a broken heating element in the outside of a guest house.

Is the elite ready to go shopping in Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and to define what those who wish to achieve prosperity and work in Britain want to change about our relations with the EU.
To achieve this purpose, we asked the largest and most comprehensive question of British economists and asked them what they thought about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov asked over 1.000 headstrong from the economy who represent about the size of the UK's companies, sectors and regions.
The results of the question will surprise a lot.
We've found that the majority of the companies outside Europe are now exporting and focussing on countries that modernize and grow while the states stagnate in the EU.
They wish that governments should promote new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil instead of a long and intensive process to reform the corrupt EU institutions.
When asked their opinion on certain legal issues – from the Kartell Act to the product law – the majority of the economics director thinks that the control of these key competences should be taken back to Westminster.
In general discontent over the Binnenmarkt, according to the companies' claims that the cost of the Brussels rules would make it easier for them to become part of Europe's trade zone – even 40 percent of the largest companies agreed to be the most traditionally friendly in Europe.
At last, and that's what most economists say, a clear majority of British voters supported a course of change in the Abroad and a relationship with the EU, which is not on politics.
This understanding, which occurs in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is facing a "sinful change" that threatens the behaviour of Britain again.
It's about a lot: a change of the treaty and better conditions for Britain would lead to a vote in 16 percent against the continuation of the EU.
The premier shouldn't doubt: this question shows that the British economy is behind his plan to negotiate the new terms for the EU.
She shows, too, that the companies expecting a new agreement expect a marked shift in power back to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, as the Eurozone moves towards a more aggressive economic and fiscal union.
Priorities must be placed on jobs and growth in Britain, as the result of our inquiry shows how a stronger focus on labour and a fundamental change in the regulation of the British government mean for companies.

Learning instead of working: Pilot project for unemployed in tourism.
A pilot project for the tourism industry was started in the Mecklenburg peninsula.
Under the direction of the Bundesarbeitsagentur, 49 women and men already studying in the field will work as technical staff for hotels and guesthouses over three winters.
It's no use crying over six-hour courses, said Carmen Howcher from the work agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits were numerous: the participants wouldn't be without jobs, the companies lacked skilled staff who are always lacking in hotels and guesthouses, and the agents couldn't afford to work hard.
In the project, the Industrie- und Handelskammer in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) are also involved.

General Motors is calling for new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the suspension.
General Motors will call back nearly 19.000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks by the end of 2014. To fix a problem with manual transmission, a division of the U.S.A.R. for vehicle safety said on Friday.
There may be a defect in the mechanism for the removal of seats in some cars.
For this reason, they don't meet the European directives for the safety of vehicles with headrests.
If the vehicle is towed from behind, it's possible that the headrests of the insassen aren't properly protected so as to create an increased risk of injury, said the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The restored models were manufactured between the 1st and 10 September.
The production of the GM trucks began in June, marking the most significant model start for the leading US-based car manufacturer since the collapse of 2009.
General Motors informed the driver of the accident on October first.
The NHTSA could not check the impact of the government shutdown on auto sales in October.
The sales of the new Silverado and Sierra trucks for the model year 2014 rose by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, said General Manager on Friday.
Chevrolet sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks in October.
The GM group rose by 1,4 percent to 37,47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Mother in the forest shivers and rents out.
When his mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest and continued to collect her rent and care.
To be able to afford further rent and care, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger grazed his dead mother in the forest after the policemen raided it.
At first he cut the death of the 89-year-old, then he cut the money for more than twenty years.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for drugs, as a spokeswoman said on Friday.
The next day the man hid the woman in a forest not far from Helmstedt.
The man had already been arrested in May: once upon a time, it was discovered that the pregnant mother no longer needed any medicines.
The exterminator told the renter that his mother had gone to Spain.
Since the policemen noticed something strange, they continued to investigate.
It became clear that the two had lived in a similar flat for more than 15 years, before he finally took care of them.
The 67-year-old finally accepted the death of his mother.
A warrant denied the police any points for a capital crime.

No-one in the press complains about the controversy surrounding the media law.
We're in a scary position, and you may ask yourself: What does the Parliament intend to do to make just the richest possible tomorrow? read the headline in the paper, which denies that the constitution is correct.
The law is harsh and very strict, and we'll stick to it, said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media outlet "must be taken seriously because it is a prolonging arm of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenia's position in the global economy.
I hope that the President listens to us and we ask him to sign this petition and send it back to the parliament", he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government through the new law put the media effectively in a breach, writes The Standard, Democracy and Speech Freedom in Kenia had "a heavy blow", and called the proposal "dramatic".
The resolution is part of a series of measures designed to strengthen national security after the attack by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The kenian media were drawing the attention of the authorities because they showed footage of security cameras on which the terrorists set fire to the luxurious shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to the arrest of two journalists and a leading media organisation, even though the removal of the media after a press conference was carried out.
Following the new law, media houses can be punished with a fine of up to 20 million kenian newspapers and individual journalists with up to one million in addition to the risk of losing their professional reputation or being banned from official press accreditation.
In addition, the tribunal has the right to sue the victim if there is no payment of a penalty.
According to Daily Nation, "there is only one crime that most radiosenders commit in the bankrott".
In addition, the paper believes that these measures could have a detrimental effect on their description of "lethal blogospheric" Kenia.
If they turn the media into silence, politicians could inadvertently do whatever they want to.
We'll never know for sure, wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in the United States who describes the media as a crucial factor in public life.
Politikers themselves can lead the country into the dark and bring us back to the days of the hunter and murderer," he said.
The kenian legislators have already taken notice of the public anger in the past.
In May they agreed to put the rules of the national assembly back into force and put their fiduciary pensions back into force about 532,000 schilling a month – they are among the highest in the world.

The Jagdolen group in Germany under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musises on parrots (natural-sounding tunes) for old, original French melodies.
The bears are wearing protective clothing because they usually accompany rodents, horses and dogs on horseback.
The party is taking place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30.
Supreme Court confirmed Obama's health law.
It's a big victory for Obama: The US Supreme Court decided today that Barack Obama's health law is reasonable.
With five to four votes, the judge found that the individual law of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) allows US citizens to opt out of a health insurance or pay a fine in the framework of the state's taxation authority.
The highest judge John Roberts struck down the side of the four liberal members of the chamber while the judges Scalia, Alito and Kennedy voted against it.
The judge also confirmed the rest of the 2700 pages comprehensive treaty and, further to the contrary, the view that if the law were to be passed, the federal government should either extend the Medicaid expansion or all the state Medicaid funding would not be constitutionally restricted.
The case brought against the law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was signed by all the leading republican presidential candidates, including last year's presidential candidate Mitt Romney, in the election campaign 2012.
From luck of the dreaming chamber, the sound echoes.
Glück is a bird that manages to reach only dreamy chambers.
In this silence, the first chairman of the club, Wolfgang Henne, wrote the history and the subject of the club "Helfing Hands".
On Saturday night, the club celebrated its tenth birthday, which could have already proved to be a big success.
The first chairperson Henne detailed the work of the club.
He himself was the first time he'd been in Mauritius at the Cheyennek House in Nouakchot.
In consequence, a further cooperation developed, and the Gymnaecol Henne carried out numerous operations in front of town on several occasions.
While the speeches were being shown, pictures of the speeches were projected on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary party could take a picture of the events mentioned.
The other side of the club was shown.
It's a former police car.
Rainer Prewo, the former chief executive officer of Nagold, had proposed to replace this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, will be acting as a consultant for the club.
In 2008, the slums of Baierbronn covered the wall for nearly a week the hospital's emergency department in Socogim, a suburb on the fringe of the capital city, was set up by volunteers.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-to-child health centre in Nouakchott.
Particularly interesting in the times when the birth centre was supposed to be set up in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medical student, such as Henne for example.
Because of the political instability in the country, many doctors came to Germany to help them settle in different areas.
Containers with material are sent to Africa regularly, so in March this year medical equipment, medicines, bandages, beds and glasses are sent to hospitals.
Initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel provided a rich local context when he recounted the experience of the Stammheim musicians supporting the club on their way to Mauretani.
When his personal reasons for leaving were to name his work in the field of accounting as a young administrator.
When it became clear how much money had gone on, he decided to help Africans control a budget through the people.
In addition, Fuchtel said that global economy and global love of people are vanishing.
It's not to be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think it is.
Gran Canaria doesn't go far to Africa.
The removal of the more than 100 years old stonemasons from the town's old school buildings to the roadside should be put back on the map of the city's cost of living.
In the days before the Kilbig, in the first works of the Sanitation of the nearby Schultz, a small winkelmauer was built to stabilize and restore the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with a balustrade.
The next step is for Alexander Misok of the Bräunland Council to incorporate the landscaped areas in the planning process and to create a sustainable plan for the old wall.
There's supposed to be a cost-benefit study to be carried out before the council decides and sets the table for future action.
A decision on this will have to be made by the next year, if not already.
After the Sanation, plowing and planting of the old schoolyards within the two sides of the 1912 erected school must be taken as a precautionary measure to make the inadequate entrances to the school from the ground up and to create new dormitories.
The historic, one hundred years old embankment of the old fort to Kirchstrasse is mainly water- and frost-damaged because there's no drainage, maintenance works are insufficient and a leaky gutter goes up to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones are indicative of climate change, but the wall isn't being mended at the moment.
A strong wall is essential for a student to use the school hostel, as the current works are being carried out.
Strictly speaking, the budget for 2008/2009 was already planned for, but high unplanned expenditures caused a decline.
A key word in the historical resuscitation of schoolchildren, which was used for filming, will be spoken by the local newspaper.
If guidelines from this side come, then the city's rabbits will be fed up by the dentists.
The pupils at the Bräunlinger primary school who are now being taught in a well-maintained old school building with new auditoriums can soon use the old library.
USA: Flights from Los Angeles to the airport.
An unknown person set fire to the LAX terminal on Friday morning (Friday afternoon).
While the airport staff were talking on Twitter about the short-lived service, the guardian was in a panic, reported the Los Angeles Times. The man was dead.
Even a security guard was killed.
Several suspects were reported in the media.
President Barack Obama will keep informed about the situation, said the white house spokeswoman, Jay Carney.
The incident took place at Terminal 3, witnesses reported seeing a gunshot with a rifle in one of the departure halls.
A traveler told CNN that many people were looking for protection in the desert.
Travellers had cried and children were crying.
Panik broke out under the covering of the blanket, many people hiding in fear behind chairs.
He heard two jokes, says a traveler in the Los Angeles Times.
A TSA employee has been injured in the foot by a shoe injury.
The scene was like a movie.
Since he was put in a security area, the man said.
They're said to have fallen near a security checkpoint.
The airport security guard is evacuated.
On television, you could see how many ambulances and ambulances were heading towards a terminal.
Hundert people were taken out of the building in safety.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special operations team and a nearby army unit.
As the airport's Twitter account revealed, the incident began at 9.30 a.m.
The wayways were blocked, according to CNN, forming a long back.
Until there were delays in the air traffic, it was said.
However, there were several birds watching from the start on CNN.
Terminal 3 is manned by small US airlines.
LAX is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Goodbye: Still more security for pedestrians.
They're not far from each other by a hundred metres: on Tuesday, the new 33-foot tramway at the village park was put into operation - in front of the old roundhouse.
Are there two buildings so close together: Absence or Slumber?
That question was clarified by the mayor yesterday.
The council chamber was installed at that time because this is the safest way out of school, explained Eckert yesterday.
The escalator ensures safety for both cyclists and bus drivers, as well as mountain dwellers.
The plant put into operation yesterday was important for the crossroads Sulzburg-Kirch.
We have the museum, two churches, the Kurfürst, the bus station, a doctor and a bank, as well as the traffic flow from the city centre.
"Because of the high traffic and foot traffic, a further set of lights had to be added to the safety", said Eckert.
This confirms Peter Arnold of the Land Council of Offenburg.
According to current statistics, about 12 000 vehicles in the village of Gutach are involved in about ten percent of the traffic, said Arnold.
That's why building another light is necessary: "Security just doesn't work here," says Arnold.
In total, four traffic checks were carried out, but a roundabout was planned, though the main road to Sulzbach/Kirchstrasse was blocked again because of the embankment.
During the site selection of the light-bulbs, Arnold said that we've found a few extra transporters for us with particularly long wooden trunks to see whether these vehicles can go out of the Sulzbach on the B 33 without the use of the adaptors.
The about 15 000 euros petrol-guzzler itself is the "modernest on the market today", explained Arnold.
The plant is equipped with brightly lit LEDs that can be clearly recognised by drivers when they drive a car.
And sparse is she, too: The older lights are about 100 Watts, but the new ones are eight Watts.
There are three light stations on the way.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: It's equipped with two radars.
Pushing the pedal to the left, the above radar detects the traffic light.
If the road is open, it will take about 15 seconds for the walker.
A further radar monitor checks to see whether the threshold can be cleared for pedestrians.
If a group of people cross the road or walk across the street, the traffic lights will be extended so that everyone is sure to cross the railway tracks," said Arnold.
Of course, drivers who drive here as partners need to think and follow the way.
It wasn't the case yesterday: camouflage showed the lights on a top-of-the-range car, sparking a bright red.
Long-term earnings are paid.
Sech men's teams fought for the title at the tennis tournament.
At the end of the day, the team's captain declared the final match.
A team of tennis players from the sports club Rohrdorf were invited to the annual tournament of the local association and friends.
Fun at tennis was the main focus of the tournament.
There were five games in the plan, where each player played against everyone.
The game was played in double-spaced with a long sentence lasting up to nine points or maximum 45 minutes.
Anja Schmid is running the tournament.
The tournament was led by Anja Schmid, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronem.
After the first three games and a lunch break, the tournament entered the final phase.
The favourites Andre Maier and Matthew Bronner were level with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (in the absence of the SG Rohrweiler), so that the final two matches had to be decided.
During the ceremony, Carmen Müller was able to pass the poppy race finally to Andre Maier/Matthia's bread, which had been the longest of the bunch.
In the second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmic.
The bronze tipped reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team's asphalt cleaner.
After lunch, coffee and cake were the highlight of the tournament.
The air service of the North Sea coast freed up a number of birds.
A bird that had been found nesting on a northern shore of the Mediterranean was released into the wild again by air.
The waterway was flitted by a kite into Aberdeen last month, where it was rescued from the Scottish Animal Protection Agency in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "The lake was probably a winter migration from North Europe, which was thwarted by the strong winds over the northern sea."
The bird seemed to be looking for the dead bird on the mountain.
He added that he couldn't continue to fly, so we asked for help.
When she left, the water department was back fit and healthy.
Underground railways connecting the United States and Mexico have been built.
One of the most travelled tunnels between the United States and Mexico, complete with lighting, air conditioning and electric railways, has now been discovered.
The US government described the broken tunnel as one of the most dreadful tunnels they'd ever found.
The tunnel, spanning a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses in the vicinity of Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, United States.
In the opposite, there are a lot of empty warehouses that make it easier to store petrol-powered trucks.
The tunnel was closed before it could be reopened to the public, explained the authorities.
During the excavation of the tunnels, eighteen ton of marihuana and 148 kilograms of coke were recovered, as did the prosecution.
According to the police, three men who were working as a driver were arrested for possession and sale of marijuana and cocaine.
You are sentenced to life in prison between ten and twenty.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers set up an unmanned underground network of waterways.
The tunnel is the largest passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana eruption in Central Macedonia in October, which presents the challenge of how they can bring their product to the consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 meters long walkway, linking a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Foreign workers with a visa of 457 may be entitled to "Eight Hours".
The government is considering expansion of measures to include an "Equality Test" for foreign workers with a visa number 457.
If the test is to be carried out, he'll bring up a criteria to prevent hiring unqualified workers or using it as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
Today, a motion of the government was passed in response to the former chairperson of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, who condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be perceived by neighbours Australia.
'Seconds like Australia to recruit workers' and 'Australians to recruit first' are very unlikely to attract employers when it comes to promoting a safe work environment, said the Australian Institute of Technology today.
Historian view is that white workers should be protected, and if some in the region emulate this historic artefact, I wouldn't wonder.
The proposal for a change of government includes twelve measures that were considered by former prime minister Chris Bow.
Minister of State Brendan O'Connor, who was talking about human trafficking in Sri Lanka yesterday, said five of the recommendations have been implemented, but the others are still being implemented.
If the "Economie" is taken over, then someone who asks for a visa could be checked to see whether the applicant's application is true in those cases where the applicant has been working with the manager or a relevant person of the supporting company or is personally involved."
Companies could, among other things, be obliged to disclose the number of employed workers in the number of 457, after having initially only wanted to hire a small number of workers, eventually hiring hundreds.
Under those stars a 35-year-old Syrian asylum likely to be in a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week with a refugee boat.
The wounded nine-year-old boy who came with him to Australia after death is being looked after by an adult cousin, who was on the boat as well.
Australian authorities brought the man to the hospital where he died.
Norfore: a northern town lights up with red light.

Finally! Mayor Steinar Bergsland yelled at the start of the programme on telly 2.
Some talons were warming up the sun, while others put on some safety-boosting umbrellas.
In winter, you had to ride a horse on a nearby mountain.
Earlier ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen proposed lighting the stones in the valley with mirrors.
This basic principle has been in place since 1913.
After more than a year of debate, the council decided to award the city council the 5 million euros (about 615 000 euros) project.
A similar construction has been covering the Italian Alps for several years, creating a winter wonderland of beautiful sunshine.
Union and SPD have launched coalition negotiations on the issues of Inner and Justiz.
That's why the relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Under and above, it's about direct democracy, executive order and the constitution.
On the day of the meeting, the working group on migration and integration also wanted to extend its consultations.
It should be discussed under the heading of double citizenship, in which both sides have opposites.
The SPD wants the ban on birth of gay children in Germany to be abolished - the Union rejects a double pass.
Concerning the issue of return, which isn't on the agenda this Friday, the SPD raised its objection to a demand by the CSU.
A vigilante is a "flight for the common good and, as a result, for the environment, declared the SPD-Verhandlungsführer for the subject of return, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his party.
There are dangers of overflowing traffic on roads that already have major accidents.
The introduction of a wall for all dogs would be only a first step in the long term.
There's a chance that the cost of living will be reduced to a later date, he said.
Squirrels disturb apartment dwellers.
Rhine Midgard invested heavily in the country.
They describe the coming coals on the shore.
The company has several irons in fire at the site.
Rhine Midgard is concentrating on wind turbines, noting the coal mine.
Black lights the coals on the pallet in front of the store.
Two large, blue halogen and back-up generators can either turn the coals here as needed or sell them.
In every movement of the shock devices, a sharp warning noise is blowing across the ground.
The signals are meant for safety and are regulated by the law, says Matthias Schrell, head of the Rhine Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
When the wind is bad, it's hard to hear - and that's why there are some complaints from people from the town.
He took the cases very seriously and, as a result, got in touch with the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In a recent meeting with the authorities, they said they were now planning to keep the registers updated with technical measures.
In the future, he will also set about the open dialogue with the neighbours.
Denn Matthias Schreck still has a few things to say about the site.
With the construction of the Niedersachsenbrücke, Rhine Midgard remains on the coal import for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe.
Thanks to the 18,5 metres of slalom lying before the terminal, it can be safely carried out that way for Capesize buses.
In this year, we're going to cut the three million ton mark in order for us to move forward," she screams.
In the vicinity of the eon-coal mines, import coals are being turned into power plants in the Northern Hemisphere.
If then the GDF-Suez plant gets on the network, it will produce about five million tons of carbon dioxide a year.
The three shipyards on the bridge and the second transport network could make up to 10 million.
Kindergarten found a private buyer.
The building is in good hands, says Winterlings Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street was sold to a private person.
The council decided not to sell the property in his recent meeting.
The building changed its bells to a "fair price".
The community is satisfied, said Maier.
The budget was set at 100 000 euros.
It's not clear yet how the new owners want to use the old kindergarten.
The mayor is right that winterlings are responsible for the building by someone else in the winter, so it doesn't have to be used for the enjoyment of the house how to heat, look after the garden and clear the way out.
"This expense is gone now", says Maier.
Halloween 2013: In numbers.
When I was young, Halloween was a little bit weird.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay late and dress up for the neighbours.
Today, I've gotten dressed up for Halloween.
In the past two years I haven't been ready to share my apartment with sweets, and I won't probably do that this year either.
According to statistics, I'm a black sheep on Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year and spend around 6,9 billion US dollars on candy, cosmetics and souvenirs, according to the US Department of State's National Retail Federation.
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is trending.
The coffers will make about 1,2 billion of the 6,9 billion that have been left over from the US dollar, according to the NRF.
In this year, there are plenty of unrelenting oppositions to the last scream.
Women no longer have to wear fancy clothes; now they can also eat authentic food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
While men are out, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I predict that stuntmen will be in the Instagram feed this year.
According to Google, the most popular zombies are Batman, Pirates and Hexen.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We wrapped our dogs up last year and weren't alone in my first birthday.
Tatsually, Americans spend 330 million dollars on their pet food this year, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of "hot dogs".
When it comes to sweets, we're not joking.
The United States will spend nine billion dollars this year, according to the Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of sugar, lilies, bonbons and rubber.
Good news for the US Department of State 41 million people who join the chant "Sweats or Souls" through the quarter.
Sadly, we'll buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – don't mention it to us – will eat it.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the delicious candy corn; however, it's sold in 15 million kilograms for Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweetware Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion pounds of corn.
It's a puzzle I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing is more common during Halloween than the houses in which it is.
You've got some great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "The House of Shame" and "The House of Horrors".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized cottages in the United States that earn 500 million dollars each year, so America glows, and those wonderful photos on which you put your trousers in pink and then your friends post on Facebook, where you don't see them again disappearing, and one after another, a comment read as "better face impression".
But finally we come to a compromise.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the great pumpkin when we were kids, and the bark of a pumpkin is like the bark of a Christmas tree – something we've done when we were little.
Luckily, the website "Baby in Kürbis" didn't start until last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up trying to eat the carrots and not eating them.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on groceries, according to the US Census Bureau.
The zucchinis that slowly decay in the nursery are probably from Illinois, where they were harvested a total of 245 million kilograms this year.
If you really want to point, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, Californien and pick up some chickens from their 921 kilogram heavy kibble.
There's no place like prison.
Because of widespread human trafficking, extortion, violence, and dangerous bodily injury, the court sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. George to life imprisonment.
The former U.S. Army, which had been working in Afghanistan as a security officer after two arrests, declared a guilty verdict in a court of law.
In five cases he met women through the use of the internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to them in response to their wishes for several weeks.
He used violence and trembling to commit suicide.
The opinions of the women who slapped him for some years held his hand.
Through the use of mobile phones and SIM cards, he makes contact with women outside the world.
Together with a colleague who was teaching the women, he took them to various boardrooms in the south-west.
There he had to watch her part in order to control her actions.
In front of the court, the accused first claimed that he suffered from a serious injury when colleagues in Afghanistan killed him in an explosion.
Having had a psychiatrist's clear doubt about the psychological limitation and, as a result, a limited capacity to repay, the 33-year-old filed a comprehensive confession.
The court had to put an end to the shameful women.
As a crime syndicate reported, after a first alert by phone surveillance measures, at least four other cases of widespread human traffic were identified.
The abandoned conversations were marked by high aggression.
In later arrests, the killers confirmed her martyrdom.
A further evidence that one of the women's body was covered with blue feathers hasn't made a statement until today.
It's about "his completely broken personality", violence and abuse in this meat as normal.
The accused complained of his behaviour yesterday.
He has gotten out of these circles and wants to lead a normal life, he said.
Tripods claim to have been brought up by ostriches.
Against the former minister of labor, Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being prosecuted by the state's anti-corruption commission.
The former NSW minister of state denies that the rules on maritim violence have changed, asking his political mentor Eddie Obeid to have ratified three subdivisions on state-owned land.
The Independent Commission against corruption (ICAC - Unabhängige Commission against Corruption) has carried out its investigations on Friday to find out whether there were any changes in the way two restaurants and a café operate in August 2005 without an explanation of their operation.
Now because of the investigation, Tripods were suspected to be interested in the land when Tripods invaded a plot of land on the same day as Lynn Ashpole did a lightning strike.
In the years of talks that began 2005, the government announced plans to raise taxes on farm animals.
The peasants were against it and wanted to have longer runs.
In 2009, the contracts for the companies on the circular quay were extended to pay the equivalent of 2.5 million dollars an annum to the company, without any public approval.
Tripodi, who was the port minister from February 2006 until November 2009, had originally spoken out for public tenders.
But he denied that he had made any changes to the requests for Obeid, confirmating that Tripodi had asked for a change in the constitution of the government.
One of the ICAC's recorded telephone conversations between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had switched to the port department after working for Obeid at the fisheries authority.
Was the subject of this telephone conversation the enforcement of trade rules? asked the commission chairman Anthony Whealy.
No, answered Tripodi.
I can't remember what was promised, but it wasn't at all.
It's not clear between me and Mr Obeid.
NSA investigations strengthen company paranoia because of the state's surveillance.
At the end of August, a German policeman was deep in the US-Konsulat in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
According to the Bundestag (BVT), the German interior service should photograph the Dach of the US-Außenposten, less than five km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to promote the concept of surveillance and the action led to a word exchange between the USA and the German foreign ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US-American Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the United States didn't have any options for foreign spying on companies that employ foreign workers to steal their international competitive advantage or their profits.
But since Edward Snowden, who became a senior employee in the US spying operation, hasn't been able to convince European governments and corporations that they can call on the head of the department.
Reports by the US National Security Agency that the Brazilian oil company Petrobas was sacked and the US-based cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, put the corporate paranoia on hold because of the state shutdown.
The rumour that Kanzler Angela Merkel's phone has been dead for ten years may have been true.
If the most powerful person in Europe can enter the Visier, then there are certainly strategic goals for companies.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US agencies and companies transparent.
I think it's possible for these data to be used against each other.
Germany needs to wake up, says Oliver Grün, president of the BITMi, a small and medium IT company in Germany.
Deutsche companies believe that the United States is now facing a nearly as high risk when it comes to industrial spying and data theft, as the case was raised by the consultancy firm EY in July.
In the sworn documents, however, there was no evidence that the United States had transferred the operations of foreign companies to its own company.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet technologies and they should reduce their ability to use the USA.
The companies are skeletons about that.
In the Bundestag, it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them again.
That's not how it works, says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If you wanted to build a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let them die before 20 years.
Everything in Germany is subventioned from coals to agriculture.
Everything, from the IT department.
Dennoch, the scope and technical affinities of the Snowden thrillers were on top of the US spy agency companies that had seen the largest spying crime in China before.
Cloud computing is undergoing a big change, because European CEOs are now aware that in the USA, stored data is subject to the US's own laws and therefore potentially harmful.
According to a survey by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade organisation, conducted questionnaires on the prospects of the US-US data mining activity with Prism about ten percent of the not-in-USA members intending to use a US provider.
Jim Snabe, vice-president of SAP, says: We see a new question from customers who haven't yet answered for a year: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that these are safe in this space?
Many German managers think that recent reports only confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore must be monitored for price.
Economic spying isn't a surprise.
It's always been this way.
It's been a subject for many years, and the debate hasn't changed fundamentally, says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us on the commercial and industrial level, for it is in national interest to defend our company.
The company's performance usually doesn't take into account the countermeasures that are being brought up, because it diminishes competitive advantages.
Employees at large companies have long complained that using a free USB stick on a desk or leaving an unlocked laptop in the hotel room, a spokeswoman said.
Ulrich Hackenberk, chairman of Audi, says that the standard practice has been to ban mobile phones from being used as headphones for years.
The German government advises managers to use simple mobile phones when they go abroad, because smartphones may be commutable.
The prepaid cards are being thrown away.
However, there's a concern that small and medium companies won't tolerate hacking and surveillance.
There are a lot of such companies in Germany that are market leaders in their respective countries.
Small and medium companies often lack the experience, the personnel and the financial resources to effectively protect against unauthorised access, says the BVT in a report.
The USA warns its own companies against foreign economic activity.
According to the Washington Post, in the US National Intelligence Estimates in February, France, Russia and Israel hid behind China on Rang two of the countries which sought to collect economic data from hacking attacks.
A board member of a German blue chip company said that when it comes to economics, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in a recent interview as saying: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, when they fight against terror, are outspread by their recruits."
When the horse breeders in Schar in Cardiff decided to breed the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was ahead of it.
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The knife, which hasn't even been in kindergarten yet, and only just a few months ago, had its first steps taken, and his Shetland Pound of tea tumbled through the three rounds, bagging the first prize, leaving behind 30 adult opponents behind.
The unbreakable couple, both big, were praised for their appearances, behaviours and manners in the all-boys competition, which will be held from the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition with men and women wearing elegant necklaces, he put his telly cap into a freckle and led the two-year old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to deal with the ponies that lay far over his age.
And coffee was nominated for his standing and personality.
Fenton had coffee as a present for his third birthday last March and has been giving it to the Shetland Pound every day since then.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: Coffee and coffee are a great mix.
You had to enter the entire competition and went off the podium with gold and rosette.
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with coffee, and we were all delighted when he won.
Full-time visitors to the arena said he was so beautiful that she wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been riding horses for more than ten years.
Howells said: The whole audience was as electrified, and everyone applauded him and clapped his hands together."
He ran on the pitch all the way to the arena, and even though he looked so winking, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, trappers and chickens and has two chickens to feed him.
It won't be long before he gets on the horse of the year, and I'm sure he'll be fine.
A spokeswoman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."

Caretaker at the small English cottage.
In the past five days of care in response to the Natura 2000 project, a group of engaged participants met at the small Englishhütte in Ibach.
Aufgrund of suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut in this day from the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, such as the Kaiser, described this area as the glacier's summit, making it the ideal backdrop for magnificent views.
He thanked the presenters for their willingness to work and stressed that the funeral service is an appropriate instrument to strengthen the bond between man and nature.
He gave every citizen the chance to act themselves in nature.
In addition to the tourist aspect, there can be a concern for the environment.
The environmental aspect of Friederike Tribukait was explained by the Department of Natural Resources of the Government of Freiburg in connection with the opening of the Treaty of Versailles, which took over the protection of the landscape, and the successful operation.
The tourist destination of the Weitblick is Tribukait with the aim of preserving the starkly cultivated old temperate valley through its special protected habitats, opening and connecting to the still existing weiders.
Best-of-breeds such as rare butterflies and scorpions can't wind barriers in form of woods.
They need these free connections to keep themselves.
Tribukait said she doesn't plan on breaking a line for the planned biospheric area.
In this plan, the current measure isn't just a temporary measure.
A biospheric area offers the possibility of sustainable socio-eco-social development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNEP and, therefore, a permanent extension of the life project and the existing care for the future.
Following these varied activities, the director of the theatre, Christoph Wehle, and the head of the project, Cornelia Bischoff, divided the volunteers into groups.
The tall trees had already been sown in the field, but the forstling was eventually ready to go.
A group of volunteers should take care of the removal of wacholders and the care of a dry stone.
The goal was the free view point.

A rescue package of more than three25 million Australian dollars will be used for the treatment of malaria.
The Australian government is under the harsh conditions that have been imposed by the rescue package over three25 million dollars australien for the maintenance of the health system to ensure that the government can not misuse the money.
State health minister Tanya Plibersek said the Commonwealth will take "unprecedented measures" to respond to a crisis caused by an alternating population of the island states.
The funding for a period of four years was decided in consultation with the independent Tasmanian Abgeordnete Andrew Wilkie.
The government has signed a treaty that, in our opinion, addresses the unique challenges facing the United States today, said Plibersek.
The package of 325 million dollars includes 31 million dollar assistance for the election process.
Through the next 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and treatment of patients with a history of graue, they should be stopped.
In addition, there are money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care for stationed patients, specialist training, services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system of electronic health records in local hospitals.
These investments are in line with the ideas that some concerned health workers said they were the best way to improve the local health system, said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister relied on a strict reporting and reporting duty on the Australian government.
The government must keep the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth, and every month it is reported where additional funds have been allocated.
A three-member commission will be established to ensure that the health service providers in the country are as effective as possible.
According to Wilkie today, the 325 million dollar would be hardly useful if "none of the reforms that will put the public health system on a sustainable course"
Without fail, he urged the government to respond to his request for help, which he first brought to the Premier at the beginning of May.
I'm sure that the federal government will be able to make a significant contribution to the public health system of the United States, according to Wilkie.
According to the government of the United States, these election results will far exceed the recent average.
But the health-political spokesperson for the opposition on the Bundesebene, Peter Dutton, thinks that the present announcement is just a "pragmat solution".
We're in a good place because the Labor Department cut 430 million dollars from the health system," he said on ABC.
It can't be that a government cuts half a million dollars from the system and the Commonwealth 300 million, pretending to be good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not even a single dollar of the rescue package will be used to pay for additional office space.

Speakers come from the Bible.
About 40 women attended the last women's breakfast in the evangelistic church of Bisingen this year.
The topic of the day at the community house was "Springwursts from the Bible" and "Reforms from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairperson of the church council, gave a lecture after breakfast on the bibliography of the congregation.
"Springwords contain vital facts, rules or warnings," she explained.
She translated several sentences with the appropriate bridging and explained the meaning.
Speak of words like this: woodpeckers are awake as if falling from their eyes, casting an eye on someone who's asleep and washing his hands in shame.
More often than not, the referees also let their listeners rate which syllable it was.
During the Middle Ages, the minister of the church, Christel Dehner, said that all good things are three, but nothing bad.
She explained the meaning and origin of the words they called "Back in the past".
A tombola was lost in the end.
The prices were set to rise on a table and were humorously written down before they were handed to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round, Roman Waizenegger was also elected mayor.
He could be called the Dostojew of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a godfather, a metaphysicist; his novels and stories also have some serious irony.
Verbalize the landscape in the desert: the sharp eyes, the brow, the high forehead.
And just as F.J. Dostojewski with his massive oeuvre as an eloquence to the Russian Church understands, Philip K. Dick is a prophet of the United States who, in his own country, has something to do with it.
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag, but the Haffman's catalogue with the 118 stories generates two thousand dollars.
Dick explains America - the Reich of the most impressive technological advances, coupled with paranoia, security awareness and the belief that it is electrified.
Dick had a good idea: his late books read like a mix of the offending of John and a computer manual.
Perhaps he was mad when he planted his chicken.
He's already figured out that the computers are divided.
He wrote a theology of computers and asked what makes a programmer different from his fellow programmer.
That's the problem of the day.
That kills.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspire directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minds' Report" comes from 1956, in which he chronicles the cold war and the McCarthy Tribe.
This is the principle of "pre-violence", also known as "pre-crime", a term used in the white house for the more or less official doktrin.
In Dicken world, which resembles our horrific past, we look braver in the future - and the police attack.
We deal with individuals who violate no law, says the head of the committee.
We'll catch her before she can commit a violent crime.
And: "In our society there are no killers, so we have a prison full of murderers." They read time.
They take it easy for droughts to happen, and make sure that the criminal law is not actually implemented.
Dick's story acts like the curtain on the anti-terror movement and the silence of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: The same goes for Obama's Dr. Philosophie and -Praxis.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief says there's no violence left, the army controlling everyday life - and what's left of the state.
Then the vigilante will be vigilant and a future crime will be committed.
The system is spinning.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It's finding his own conditions.
Don't just kill innocent people, but build on it.
The system creates the danger it is posing.
Philip K. Dick says he always reads the truth closer.
Court blocks decision to follow NYPD's ban on smoking.
A federal magistrate in the United States blocked an order enjoining changes to the Stop and Frisk program ("Stop and fly") of the New York police department, and extinguished the judge from the case.
The 2. U.S. Supreme Court said that the decisions of judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision was made about the city.
The judge in August said that the city violated the Constitution with regard to the manner in which the program for the suspension and removal of persons will be implemented.
The city appealed against her assessment and the coordinated relief measures, ultimately deciding to establish a watchdog to monitor the police for the change of their directive and the appropriate education programmes.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the demand for execution on Tuesday.
The tribunal said that the judges should be acquitted of the case because they have violated the code of conduct for US judges, in part because it was partly supported by a series of media interviews and public statements in which they responded publicly to the criticism of the justice system.
The judge said that policemen violated the rights of Zehn thousand of people because they targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop and Frisk program in the Visier state.
She set up an external watchdog to monitor the implementation of major changes, including changes in directives, policies and duties, and carried out a pilot program with body-worn cameras in quarters carried out the most control.
In August, the city of New York declared it ready to stop the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were removed from police after a check.
A serious dispute on the employment of the city is planned for the 14th of March 2014.
Stop-and-Frisk tactics were criticised by a series of civil rights activists.
Controls of this kind have existed for decades in various forms, but during the Amts of the then-mayor Michael Bloomberg, the number of monitors rose to 684.330 in 2011, mostly black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, listening to all the minorities, gathered together to form a collective.
Those who oppose changes to the Stop and Frisk program say they're changing unfair practices and creating a trustworthy and effective police force, as well as how other police departments enforce the law.
Opponents think that changes would improve the morale of the police, but not the criminal justice system; as well, money would be spent and the wide problem of police wouldn't be solved, a problem which saw thousands of policemen under pressure in the past year ten.
The judge made it clear that she didn't do the Stop and Frisk Act, which was constitutional, but only the way in which the NYPD enforced the controls.
Jury of Bali's verdict on the murder of a bomber is incendiary.
The 202 people killed in the bombing of Bali in 2002 were angered at the decision of the court for the last defendant, Umar Patek, who said she thought should be rightfully shot.
Patek, who spent less than ten years as one of the most sought-after Southostasian people on the battlefield, was sentenced to life in prison yesterday for his role in the bombing of a prisoner of war.
He could be sacked by sentence after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was sentenced to death for the attack on two nightclubs in Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounding many more.
A coup d'état also occurred in a series of terrorist attacks against churches in India on Christmas Eve 2000.
The police had demanded a life sentence even though they were asking for the man who is known by his reputation as a master bomber but also as "Demolition Man" to be executed.
The decision came in June when a mother from Perth, who had killed her seven-year-old twin sister Jane and Jenny in the act of violence ten years ago.
She said she thought that Patek should've been condemned to death.
I really think he should follow the other guys' footsteps.
You should present him to a commission of inquiry, said Corteen in front of the AAP.
I have to live every day so that I won't get any more chickens and never see my daughters again.
The Sari club was buried in the ground when, on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 o'clock, a massive explosion in a mini-bomb that had been burning in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier an self-mordattentator had exploded a full-size backpack filled with explosives.
After the proposal, he fell into a coma three times while he was living on a diet.
Hughes said Patek earned the same fame as the three other members of the terror group Jemaah Islamiah – Amroel, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the blood attack four years ago.
Ideally, this type of person should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
Let go of life – no, there's no reason to kill him.
After killing 202 people and wounding many dogs, it's not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
Almost a year after the arrest, but finally in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad were raided, where US forces nearly killed the former al-Qaida boss Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the hearing, an FBI agent said that secret services reports showed that Pakistanis were planning to set foot in Pakistan to help break up the link between SYRIA and al-Qaida.
He didn't post, said Corteen.
He hasn't shown for a while how much he admires other people.
The verdict passed the ten-year appeal in this year's election, which began with debates in Bali and Australia.
There'll be a lot of tears this year, said Corteen.
Patek may appeal his decision.
Stagnation over Merkel in Russia is spreading.
Former US spying expert Edward Snowden could influence the US spying on Angela Merkel in his Russian asyllation.
Representatives of the German Bundesanwalt could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, said the agent.
Yesterday, the Grünen-Bundestagsabgeordnete Hans-Christian Ströbele met the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk with him about the Arctic.
The news of the rock band's revival is almost over.
A blue attack on the Rockies will be resurrected after more than four years.
A case of attempted murder, serious bodily injury and assault against two 30-year-old has started in front of the court of law in Frankfurt.
He is accompanied by strict security measures.
The accused were silent.
They should've been active in the rock scene, and then to the band.
The state department advised them that in June 2009, in collaboration with unknown contractors in Finowfurt, three men were shot and killed in a car.
All the victims were badly wounded, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have come from a rival group called Hell Angels.
They say he was a high-ranking member of Berlin.
There seemed to be a traffic jam with several cars ahead.
According to the law, it was a struggle and a power demonstration.
The two accused were both released at the beginning of 2012 in a first-degree trial.
A judge at that time said that it wasn't possible to prove that the men involved in the deadly feud were actually involved.
The soldiers were wearing masks and weren't recognized.
The bench of the supreme court lifted the judgment on the constitutional amendment and led to a new hearing in the Land Court.
One of the accused is currently in prison for a murder.
In the meantime, it was all about the reconfiguration of the processes in the Tatanacht.
When evidence was presented, the then-chairman of the committee was arrested.
In the centre of the room were phone calls between the arrested and other people that the police had stopped.
Strictly speaking, rockers almost always hold a grudge against their own laws and not enforce it.
That applies to the victims, too.
In the first case, only one of the victims was injured.
State attorney Stefan Golfier of the State Bar of Frankfurt (Oder) said on the other side of the question that new spurs have been sprouting since the last procedure.
There are eleven additional stages of negotiations for the process.
Pamela Anderson takes off her legendary blonde locks and debuts with a new bikini.
Pamela's blonde locks have been famous since her role in the television series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star to stun his fans with a dramatic new haircut.
The former baywatcher has taken a break from her long blonde locks in one of her platinum-blue short hair.
Her latest look presented the 46-year-old actress in Los Angeles on Wednesday, posting a snap shot on her Twitter page.

The number of people without jobs in October is 1.307.
Whilst the quote was up 3,1 percent from last year, it was also better than in September, when we had been expecting more, says Monika Felder-Bauer, head of the agency's sales team for work in St. Petersburg.
Because a lot of businesses were reacting to changes.
A reason for this is the old adage: "We have few skilled tradesmen in crafts, in health care and in elderly care."
Staffing offers for personal in the hotel and guesthouses have been running again since September.

Turn on the light for a long time: Watch carefully during rush hour.
Sometimes a light just won't turn green.
The contact lens in the road doesn't respond, or the light is out of order.
What to do then - drive in red?
Had a bomb hurled at a red light and the cross is open, the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker writes in the journal "Motorrad".
The time of day must be considered in order to make a decision on whether or not to fall.
Beckers advise drinking for at least five minutes before going out of the light.
Those who drive in spite of the red light have to realise that they are entirely to blame for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes don't wait long under circumstances, warn Becker, and sign an order of the supreme court.
In the case of a traffic accident, a driver ignored the light for about three minutes and had to answer for a speeding red light.
The light wasn't really broken, but it came on a little later.
A driver stopped him because of the special situation - but not for the money.
Bombardier's profits are cut in response to back on delivery and remuneration.
Bombardier announced a 15-pronged return on its net profit on Thursday, after falling orders and deliveries of planes on the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railways.
Bombardier with headquarters in Montreal also didn't publish flight tests for its brand new CSeries and didn't give any new information about whether the aircraft could be used commercially next September according to the ambitious timetables.
For the first half of a month on board the test aircraft, there were only three further starts that doubtfully prove whether the test phase will run as planned.
The results remained behind the forecast and led to a decline of over eight percent on the market of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank of Financial, gave a rating of "outperform" on "sector perform", indicating that the activity in the next one to two quarters will have a limited trend.
Although we expected lower delivery rates for airplanes, we were completely disappointed by the market development in the transport sector, said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We're of the opinion that Bombardier will order new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft is announced.
If in the coming months there are no new orders, then we expect that the market will become more skeptical.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries will be able to recapture the market dominance currently held by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced in March and went on sale for the first time in September.
But already there are binding orders for the CSeries with 177 mods, as potent buyers waiting for the results of the flight tests want to see whether the company's claims about greenhouse gas emissions and cost savings of the new diesel engines are making headlines.
At the moment, there are total 403 orders and Zusagen from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin has indicated that Bombardier intends to achieve its goal of 300 binding orders by the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The company's performance was assured to analysts and media on Thursday, adding that the programme was in the schedule.
The test aircraft isn't staying on the ground longer than expect, said Beaudoin in a telephone conference, adding that during the stand time of the aircraft, tests and software updates were carried out.
Every manufacturer makes different products.
We've decided to take a first flight and then hang up the work space we've done.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft will start on schedule in the next few weeks, while the rest will be launched from the company side.
Analysts remain skeptical whether, twelve months after the first flight of the CSeries, the first customer can take a C series aircraft into operation.
Bombardier said that the planning for the operation is in progress and will be updated over the next few months.
The slow protests against the flight test – even though they appear to be British interns – confirm our view that the operation of the first quarter 2015 will be postponed, said Doerks.
Bombardiers netted a net profit of 147 million dollar, or 9 cents an hour in the year before.
The adjusted profit per act is unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover went up by a quarter, dropping from 4,2 to 4,1 billion dollar.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a revenue of 4,56 billion dollar, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest airliner manufacturer says he delivered 45 planes in this quarter, a return of 57 last year.
The nettowers fell from 83 aircraft on 26.
The budget for the air and space agency was 32,9 billion dollar on September 30 and was unchanged from December 31.
In the area of air and space, the results were reported within our targets, but the low order of work and the overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
The market for air and space services fell by 13 percent on two billion dollar.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway company, announced that its revenue from this segment was almost eleven percent on 2,1 billion dollar.
The volume of work in the transport department was 32,6 billion dollar on September 30 and was slightly higher than that of December.
The profit margins in the transport sector were severely affected by budget problems in some large contracts.
According to the company's strategy, there will be some new standards for the coming quarter.
The Bombardier stock ticked at 8,5 percent on the day it was reported that the CEO of Google, Patrick Pichette, would also change to 4,83 kanad dollars.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier engendering Rivale, reported a 10-percent decline in its quarterly earnings on Thursday.
The laws governing electronic devices in airplanes remain in force until now in Australia.
Airpasses in Australia must still turn off tablets and smartphones when they go to the airport, despite efforts in the USA to ban the use of such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows airlines to change their rules so that passengers can read, watch or play video on their devices during critical flight phases, if they are in the category "Flight Mode".
While most of the time, airlines allow passengers to book flights, but many people find it annoying that they don't allow them to read their ebooks at the start and end of the flight.
Australian companies are watching the decision to implement the law requiring the United States' airlines to require certain personnel to work, but they don't necessarily follow immediate plans to change their regulations.
The airspace agency CASA said it would review the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia are similar to those currently in place.
The CASA does not currently have any specific rules regarding the use of electronic devices in airplanes.
The subject is subject to regulations that require airlines to keep their security constants and passengers to follow the security instructions given by the cabin staff.
Virgin has already discussed with the CASA how to use his Wi-Fi network on flights, explaining that changes need to be made but are not required by law.
We'd welcome a review of the use of electronic devices by the CASA, because we're convinced that the customer experience would improve when we offer (draconian conversation) during the flight," said a spokeswoman.
Qantas said that they'll stick to the current rules until there are other changes.
According to the current regulations, electronic devices must not be used in the beginning and during the landing, and we don't have plans to change this at the moment", explained the company.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
We're always interested in changes in rules so that passengers can benefit from them, and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
The decision in US companies depends on the age of the flotte.
You've got to prove that your aircraft can handle the vibration caused by mobile devices, and manuals, handouts, baggage labels, and customer orders have to change.
As soon as a flight company confirmed the tolerance of their flight, they can permit the use of lighter, lighter electronic devices such tablets, e-readers and smartphones in any height", the FAA said.
In rare cases where there's poor visibility, the crew will turn off the lights during the landing.
The group also recommended using heavier equipment to start and land safely under the seat or in the drawers over the seats.

Beautiful animals and delicious torts are locked in lock.
The best rabbits of different breeds and colours present the circle performance show at the town hall this weekend.
The assessments were already taken on Thursday.
Erneut exhibited this large exhibition at the town hall W514.
Breeders of so-called clubs in the circle show their best animals here, as well as young witches show their rabbits.
At the end of the day, six judges judged the quality of the numerous rabbits and were able to draw out impressive animals.
The visitors to the exhibition are well informed because the distribution of animals to the cages is carried out.
The official opening of the exhibition takes place on Saturday at 12:30.
Open to all visitors on Saturdays from 10 a.m. and on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 12:30.
The guests are also invited to a tasting of Tombola, which in exchange for cash prizes, and to a light-speech cafeteria.
Last time there was a fight.
On Friday evening, two car drivers in front of Revensdorf were seriously injured in a traffic accident on State Highway 44 near Revensdorf.
The police stopped the road at once, but it was too late to say anything about it.
However, there are a lot of evidences that should be evaluated first.
It's said that the 19-year-old boy drove a VW Golf out of town and the 38-year-old man came out from Gettorf on her Hyundai.
The two vehicles roared together, though the woman had been limping so hard that the fire brigade needed half an hour to free her from the vehicle.
The actual cause of the accident remained undecided at the moment.
Both unfortunates came from nearby hospitals.
The route remained full for about two hours.
The British police are making an arrest on suspicion of trespassing.
The British police have today announced an arrest of WikiLeaks hacker Julian Assange, who is wanted for trespassing in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said that they asked the 40-year-old Australian to pose for a photograph in front of a policeman, and added that if he didn't show up, he wouldn't be arrested.
Assange threatens the delivery of drugs to Sweden because of his involvement in a sexually motivated killing, after the supreme court rejected his ban on the delivery of drugs at the beginning of the month.
Since he hoped Stockholm would supply him with the USA, he searched for refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19th, and asked for political asylum in the US.
Scotland Yard asked a 40-year-old man to pose for a policeman at a public meeting at a police station, said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on condition of discharge.
The ambassador didn't make a comment on the political demand.
Assange feared he would be sent out of Sweden to the United States after having published more than 250.000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
Revolutionary work of church music.
At the end of his 160-year tenure, the singer-songwriter will perform two Gottesdienste with the "German Mess" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my life", which the audience enjoyed this year, the Liederkranz will conclude the Jubiläumsjahres two Gottesdienste with the performance of the German Messiah by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, 26. October, this extraordinary mass will take place at St. Martin's Cathedral Dunningen from 19 during the evening and on Sunday, 27. October, from 10.15 to hear the choir of St. John's Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe, with the original title "Singing for the feast of the holy victims of the Mess", D 872, is a geistically composed composition by composer Franz Schubert from the year 1826 and almost revolutionized the time of the Entstehung.
The mass will take place in the context of the church service, as the patron Johann Philipp Neumann had intended it.

Early research had shown that happy dogs moved their hind legs to the right (out of sight of the dog), while nervous dogs were on the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs recognise this subtle difference and respond accordingly.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: "Because people know that the brain parts of the brain react differently to stimuli, positive or negative emotions arise."
Here we're trying to show you some other things.
He noticed that in dogs exactly like humans, the right brain part of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side, and that both hemispheric muscles play different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the recent flashbacks of their artmates, the forschers watched the animals watch other dogs watching these films.
They measured the heart rate of the fourbear and analysed the behaviour.
We'll probably soon understand why the swing sometimes goes in one direction, then in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: We've shown the dog films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to distract from other aspects, and thus we could control the movement of the brains more towards left or right.
When the animals saw how a normally unsuspecting dog moved to the left (from the perspective of the weeping dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But the tension gradually turned to links (from the perspective of the dog, who was weaning), so her heart grew and she looked unreliable.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs don't intentionally interact with each other through these movements.
He's a lot more convinced that the dogs learned from experience what to do when they should be worried and when not.
When you have different behaviours with other dogs and the barking goes in a positive direction, and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then react on the basis of these experiences."
The forschers say that the findings of trainers and dog owners could help them to better understand their animals' emotions.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behaviour and guest lecture at the University of Bristol, explained that this wasn't the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs.
A team at the University of Lincoln found out that dogs' heads turn when they look at an aggressive dog and turn to the left when they look at a satisfied dog.
In another research project at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following: "Robots are more likely to be successful when their weak links are not straight than being unreliable – exactly and equally as they are in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences between the dogs in the different studies and the robots aren't interpretable as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
While there's some good reason for many different mammals to use both brain parts for different purposes, many details still need to be taken into account – and dogs aren't the exception", says Bradshaw.
Since her behaviour is so simple, it won't likely take long before we understand why the tension sometimes goes in the one direction, and sometimes in the other direction.
Tony Blair said he'd be able to use the chance of a return as a prime minister in the UK, but admitted that it's unlikely that he'll be able to make a comeback.
In an interview tonight, marking the fifth anniversary of his retirement from the army, the 59-year-old revealed his views on various domestic issues.
Since he resigned in June 2007 after a year ten as prime minister, Blair's comments mostly on foreign policy and his role as peacestifter in the Nah Ost.
On the question whether he'd like to return to the pm, Blair from the Evening Standard said: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that this will happen, either."
Blockade in Helmsford: rescuers rescued burnt legions.
The fire brigade had to deploy firefighters on the late afternoon.
A three-family house in the town hall starts fire at night.
The rescuers rescued a dead body from the house.
Rescuers found a dead body in a three-family house in front of a fire.
It's still unclear whether a resident is being harassed, as a policeman in Bayreuth said.
It had rained on the second floor of the house late Thursday evening.
When the fire brigade arrived, the firemen were already firing from a window.
The soldiers went into the apartment and found the dead in a room.
This room and another one were completely burnt.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All of the residents who weren't home while the fire broke out, the policeman continued.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire wasn't clear at first.
Competition: A cyclist drives 63-year-olds around.
According to police reports, a 26-year-old man on the way from the station to the market centre, riding a Damen-Road, heading towards the station at around 22 p.m.
Suddenly a 63 year old man from a pub on the way out of town stopped cycling, so bicycle riders couldn't complain to the police in time.
During the following clashes the footpaths against the wall, going to the ground in another round and taking a roughly 15 centimetres long squat on the head.
A rescue team brought the injured to hospital for medical treatment.
Arctic Monkeys are disappearing from sight in Glasgow because of the disease Alex Turner.

UN agrees to new goals in the fight against poverty.
The United Nations begin at once with the development of a series of new goals, which should be replaced by the ambitious Millennium Development Goals for the reduction of poverty from twelve.
In advance of the UN-Gipfels for sustainable development, which began in Rio de Janeiro last night, Australian diplomats played a key role in the proposal for "sustainable development goals", which are supposed to be implemented in 2015-2025.
They were in the final draft of the document, which was signed by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that it had come time to think about the national interests beyond the borders.
I'm happy that the member states have agreed to take a process of action which should aim at achieving universal, sustainable development goals, he said.
These goals will be built on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I won't hesitate to present this mandate to the member states for us to achieve our vision of sustainable development, based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
zdemir wants to get a degree in jazz at Stuttgart.
In the continuing debates about the future of the music halls in Baden-Württemberg, Cem zdemir, vice-president of the choir, has also put on his voice in the debate.
I think it's wrong to give up the whole school of music at the university of Stuttgart, said zdemir in the student newspaper.
Jazz and Klass is now a part of the jazz scene in Stuttgart.
zdemir, who is running for governor in Stuttgart on the 22nd of September, will vote for the Green Party.
On the basis of an expert study, a new order of five music schools in Baden-Württemberg are being proposed.
Under the supervision of the department of music, the department of jazz and pop at the University of Stuttgart is to be transferred to the Music Academy Mannheim.
Singapur was built on the back of the Middle Ages, when the crisis came.
In a shopping centre in Singapur, Janani Amirthalinga exchanged a golden armring, a ring and a pair of earrings in order to pay her daughters the tuition.
My husband and I have just bought a house, because I'm running out of money", says Amirthalinga.
Even though she earns three thousand Singapur dollars (ca. 1.730 Euro) as a manager every month and her husband works, she doesn't make up her monthly salary.
Tatsually, the demand in parts of Southostas – where the debt on the budget is so great that ValueMax, where they bought their silver, has listed the third pen on the singaporean market this week.
The buying of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapur dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but almost as cheap as an unsecure bank account.
Singapur's typically neglected buildings have an effective annual income of 17 percent, which is barely over the 15,4 percent demanded by the United States Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
Pandoras offer the advantage that there's no need to check creditworthiness or income, which makes it possible to borrow faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to penthouses, where families are feeling pressured by rising costs of living and an increasing household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit, thanks to a liberal finance policy in the developed economies look for families with low and middle incomes to build their own houses in order to offset the difference between rich and poor economies.
This week the Rating Agency Standard and Poor's growing debt to households, mainly through rising hypotheses, described as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia compared with Brazil's GDP.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of the GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Consumers are worried about the high cost of living in Thailand, which has barely escaped a technical crisis this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a persistent export deficit and a drop in consumer demand.
The end result is that people in the middle and lower income groups try to supplement their income wherever possible, says Song Seng Won, head of the CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in the price of gold in the past two years have intensified the trend towards valuing personal items, giving people the opportunity to redeem their jewellery for cash.
In Singapur, about 70 % of the gold-bearing objects found in the city's 200 forts are stolen.
The people say that the price of gold is good, so let's pluck Grandma's gold and go back next month.
EasyMoney, the largest Thai confectioner, has seen a 20-pronged customer growth in its branches over the past months.
Growth in the P&L is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Benelux and 15 further in Singapur, wants to expand not only in the newly-discovered Malaysia – where the company operates four buildings – but also outside Asien, Ye Lee Ching, vice president of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapur dollar, which was taken by the Börsegang this week.
While some creditors cited high rates in the crossfire, yes, bricklayers not only offer cheaper zincs than other lenders, but they are not directly to blame.
Children borrow objects that they already possess, and the insufficient personal value items don't increase the cost of living," she says.
The penniless business is becoming more and more popular as short-term, secured financing is accepted.
Not all people who use penguins are in financial trouble, either.
Rich people from Singapur come into the stores of ValueMax to buy gold and watches in exchange for up to 60 percent off their purchase price.
Customers from all walks of life come to us.
There are wealthier people who lend something short for a business or an investment, or small companies that need to clear their balances in cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes, they just need very quick money.

As pleased as Ralf Rangnick is with the current form of the Bundesliga side Red Bull Salzburg, the head coach of the team Sport Direction said the "Bulls" were from the referee.
At the moment, there's a dangerous thought that Mane and Alan will be put in the category of spoilers", he told the two offensive villains at a press conference in Salzburg.
Judging from the recent criticism of Rangnicks, Gelb for Mane at 3:0 against Grödner on Sunday last weekend, when the Senegalese had an embittered actor to be arrested - who wasn't allowed to play in front of the cameras.
"A grave mistake", said Rangnick, describing the referee Harkam as "completely out of order".
Harkam contributed "his part" to the downward spiral between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and goldsmith Adi Hütter after the game.
His German-speaking countryman said he thought I would behave like Roger Schmidt in every situation.
Schmidt himself didn't want to have contact with his colleagues after the sacking.
I didn't know why.
I'm the one who was insulted, said the 46-year-old.
Rangers cheered for the success, but there was a loudspeaker on the other side.
There are only two words for it: right, he said.
There's not much to be done.
The way in which the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
Changes in the winter transfer period will hardly ever happen.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
A player is asking for permission to leave the club, said Rangnick.
A study by the British government proposed to increase the benefits of the HS2-Eisenbahn project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd is being pushed to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England by starting with Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport minister Baroness Kramer said the project is helping to bring together Britain's big cities.
Transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2, it will be possible to connect Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government approved the cost of building the high speed railway between London and North England by a sum of 32,7 Mr. Pfund.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to look for further routes and travel times for North England and Scotland.
There's also the possibility of travelling by three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is to build a truly national network that connects the Great Britain and his cities closer."
We're going with HS2 because it brings us enormous advantages.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it also concerns the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to High Speed 2.
The Scottish minister of state Alistair Carmichael said: "The recent announcement is a good news for Scotland."
In the name of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael said that he was "uncomfortable" for the schottic link to the H2N2.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail network offers enormous economic benefits for Scotland, while the economic strength of Scotland also provides an argument for rapid trains in all Britains."
That's why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to explore the options for a high-speed railway connection in Scotland, which creates benefits for everyone and complements the link Glasgow-Edinburgh that the Scottish government already operates.
I look forward to reviewing the report with the British ministers next year and agreeing on the next steps.
Future-proofed flats are attractive.
Waltraud Ries actually live there.
Her house is in a quiet suburb of Stuttgart with lots of greens, an old tree, nice neighbours and not too much traffic.
There are only a few minutes to public transport in the city.
Aren't you afraid of spiders, asks Waltraud Ries, and shows a floppy spider in the attic.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason isn't necessarily a spider bite, but the fear that there are too many steps up to the house and into the flat when they get old, they explain.
To add to that, since a menopause operation, the fifty-five members of the committee have been learning in their own way how to move from factory by hand.
A short time ago, a book by her was published on the subject of "Lately living in age – Which form of living is best for me?"
"Our apartment is the best example of what's not happening at the moment," she begins to tell.
When she moved to the apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful flat in the middle of the green.
Today, in the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries think about it.
She knows, too, that she is one of the few people who ever deal with the subject of "Women in Age".
Most people won't stop it while it's going on.
Old are always only the others', she says mutteringly.
Not until the pressure is really great, do you think.
"You can't be too late, but it can be."
In her book, the interior architects present 17 housing models for a self-contained apartment in the age.
Whichever form of residence you choose, it is always an individual choice, she says.
If I were you, it wouldn't be for the age.
Even if you can afford the cost of living in the Tuscany or the UK, always think that he can get sick.
And: "Without a good knowledge of the language, people who live in the Dolce Vita are reluctant to consider becoming Australians."
There are classic models of care, alternative housing or the often quoted Renter-WG.
Everybody has their own set of ticks and mucks at any age.
If I were a living community, she would wink at her eyes.
Not quite as good as a student group with a bath and kitchen.
At any age, you just need to have your back room tidied.
While a senior citizen group can still function, the book publisher doesn't want to shut it down.
It'll have to go a little different than the traditional student group.
And sometimes you just want to take your rest, thinks she.
In this opinion, she's not alone in the capital city at least.
The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own flat for as long as possible, is the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the Citizens' Service in the age of the capital.
Their service centre deals with the subject of "being old".
That's why elderly people often take unnecessary measures just to stay in their usual surroundings, as well as the experience of the Stiftung.
There are a lot of ways to make the house or the apartment barrier-free today.
All those who are engaged in altering their homes or their flats should first get acquainted and not hire the best craftsmen.
Today, there are also specialists in alternative ways of doing things.
Even in the rental property, one or two people can dream, and when it's only the toilets that are open, the interior architect gets on board.
But not always can the existing flat be remodeled and made barrier-free, even if it's still so beautiful.
This experience had to be tempered.
There could be a lift installed within the flat, which would also provide a ladder up to the flat's entrance but would be much larger than that.
She'll continue looking until she finds the perfect object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she groaned more than the back of her apartment door.
The NSA is gathering data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden will help.
The secret service investigator Edward Snowden has a basic interest in helping Germany with the investigation of the ever-growing threat of NSA spying.
Following presentation of the Grün-Bundestagsabgeordnete Hans-Christian Ströbele in his surprise meeting with Russian snowmen about how ex-servicemen would work in a German court of justice or in front of an investigation committee.
Snowden proved he had a complicated legal situation, said Ströbel in the ARD magazine "Panorama".
A car driver is seriously injured in an accident.
A 37-year-old truck driver from Aachen was badly injured in an accident on Thursday night.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsli was heading towards Grefrath on her way out of town at 21.15.
When the left-hand side of the St. Töner road wanted to turn, they saw the approaching car of the 37-year-old.
The traffic jammed.
The athlete suffered from severe injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
The TSV Morsum is still without a point in the handball division after six games.
From now onwards, the team of Ingo Ehlers will go to the Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated their first victory at the weekend.
This game starts the season new for us.
"I hope that we finally have a head off", says Ehler.
With the exception of the longest-running hedgehog, he finally managed to get his whole suitcase.
Even Dave is playing the drums as we play the piano.
That's why we have to keep our mistakes.
In the first place, it's OK to criticise those who last leave nothing but a certain impression.
Davenport coach Thomas Panitz is feeling more relaxed after his first season in charge of Northhorn.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favourite, because everything can happen in Derby.
Regardless, Panitz will set to work in Morsum to start a series.
If it doesn't work, Jan-Mal Joda will fail.
Then the A-Jugend Joost, who is active in the A-Jugend team at Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
If it's not hot, stay at home.
Kokain-dependent counsel, warning against polizeia, must be put in jail.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave further information to Neil Scarborough about the size of the world.
The lawyer was afraid that his secret dependence on light might come from the law.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A well-known criminal, warning a large police presence that he might uncover his secret drug use, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided the underage Neil Scarborough with sensible information about the proceeds from his drug trade, after having been compelled to do it through his own cocaine search.
Known by criminals as a "reckless lawyer" with the nickname "Bash" was arrested in 2011 after the police raided his house in Scarborough, where he had represented himself in an earlier case.
When Scarborough (32) three Beutel Kokain from Blackburn, Lancashire was eating with colleagues in the auditorium.
The embarrassment meant that Dita became a regular test subject of the class, after tests showing evidence of cocain in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit card.
For eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain truthful information about the arrest of two men by the order of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were arrested at that time in connection with a major drug trafficking operation in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After the police arrested 32 other people, they were later arrested for possession of heroin and cocaine in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, continued to give information to the police because he thought that his personality could be published.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Kanzlei Forbes solicitors in Blackburn, was sentenced to three years in prison for obstruction of justice.
He bought the coke at a previous meeting.
The lawyer was questioned after the police revealed that they had regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two executions followed the suspect and showed how he went to Ditta's house, and there the suspect, in a score of 60 percent, put his golf glove under the watchful eye of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drug, Scarborough regularly spoke to Ditta, who was in charge of the Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park during their evening meal.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the doctor and then exchanged new information among the two.
Before the court was known that Tita was a "normal consumer" of Kokain, after tests A in his hair, his wallet and his credit card were found.
Ditta later was arrested, but refused to take Kokain's place, saying he had spoken with the murderous dealer because that was his duty, and claimed that her discussion was under the "law of the law".
Dita took his wallet while she tried to remove a string of credit cards, but they were secured and a hairband was sent to him.
During the hearing of the police, he admitted that he was harassed both at his private address as well as on the job, and people would call him home for legal reasons.
In court, it was known that he was one of the most significant criminals he'd ever represented, called to order execution and informed the murderer of what the murderer knew about them.
State attorney Anne Whyte said: A criminal lawyer should better know that you can't break the law than anyone else does.
Ditta will face the repercussions of his position as a prosecutor because he has cooperated with certain authorities too much.
The fragile relationship is not simply a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his statements were unsubstantiated, since he was the lawyer for that person.
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police crackdowns as much as he could, so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta put his professional standing on hold by doing that.
He stood close to certain mandates, including Scarborough, and made it clear that he was unemployed.
If I were a corrupt lawyer and received any further information from Scarborough, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, but would do that right away."
But after hearing the arrest, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said that Mrs. Ditta had taken the step of a criminal when he started to acquire drugs from organised criminals.
His cowardice led to a hopeless compromise and, as a result, made him one of the most influential members of the organized criminal organization who charged him with collecting valuable information on police activities.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure that there is no fear of losing trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has robbing this trust and trying to hide it behind the facade of his career.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the prosecutions against Dita, leading also to a conviction in three cases for possession of Kokain and justizbehib, which underlies our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to policemen and showing that no one can remove the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment after he admitted his involvement in the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Twenty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to life imprisonment for thirty years.
Ditto a section of questions and answers about his dream job Mandated in the US as a lawyer, his ultimatum guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and therein lies the motivation for his work.
At the moment, the police department can focus on a quiet Halloween night.
No less than two times were the policemen called to arrest children who were acting against their parents.
Since the domestic pests came on time and the bugs disappeared, there shouldn't have been any damage to the crops.
There were probably some sylvesterbolles in the city, but there wasn't any serious damage either here or elsewhere.
A neighbour in the village of Bishof-Freundorf reported that his dog was harmed by a burrow and his bicycle tyres were sown.
Until the police arrived, the man's cyclists were all found near each other again because the police couldn't continue to work.
A day of thanks on the way to the MGV in Dinker.
It was the 165. Fondsfest for the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" this year, and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were eager to come.
At the local pub "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmony of music to the fullest.
Traditionell is always the foundation party's most appropriate festivity to raise funds.
With the special inscription "Singing of the year", the old writer Rolf Wagener was delighted to meet the literary director.
You haven't only written a lot for us, but also made so many rounds for us, thank you very much, said the chairperson of the chorus, Erich Schlotman.
In this year, the voting for the conductor of the choir Theter Schulze with 44 participations was followed by honourable chairperson Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman of the committee, and last year's "Singing of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations.
There were five waiters for Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was presented to the committee by club president Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again created a Menü for the Extraklasse, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm" always meets its regular choruses at the club station at 11:30.
"Newly-sung, resonant voices welcome us anytime," says Schlotman.
Rat takes washing machines to Visigo.
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirsch" be widened to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the councillors have decided.
If you want to take care of yourself, you need to take care of 220 000 euros.
The German Railway will improve the Kinzal railway line in the coming year.
In particular, the safety of rail crossings should be increased - regular collisions between trains and other vehicles happen across the country.
If the community wants to implement the measures, they need to contribute a third to the cost, while the rest split the railways and the roads.
Local councillor Roland Grießhaber explained the peculiarities of the bahoon crossing to the community council.
There, the city is building a bridge in the vicinity of the tunnels to the west of the railway line.
There could be larger vehicles, such as those transporting heavy logs, standing in the way of traffic without having to block the roads.
Discretionate measures are being taken to make sure that the streets surrounding the city can be widened in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
It was debated in the community council, when some residents raised the possibility of a road closure. Thomas Kipp brought up the point that critics were asking why we didn't have so much money in our hands because there were so few cars?
Mayor Thomas Haas said that the railway tracks are regularly used for long-distance transport.
Even wood from the section "Kuhbach" will be used to transport this stretch, because the up to 20 metre long vehicles could not use the bridge because they couldn't access it from the main road.
Further to the north, the track is designated as a roundabout for those vehicles that can't use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, argumentative Haas.
Considering that the construction and maintenance of the railways in Wolfsburg are getting underway, it may be possible to bridge the "Hirs" for a longer period an important transport link.
The rumours came about to find out how much the proposed widening of the road would cost.
In light of the fact that the reopening of the railways was carried out with the intention that the necessary bridges were constructed so as to make the city's adjacent railway station accessible by about 5,5 metres.
The reopening of the railway station at the Gerberei Trautwein might pose a whole other problem, which concerns the crossing of the heavily climbed "Gerolthouse Way".
The management had been looking at the layout of the railway from the engineering firm Breinlinger, having doubts whether the planned connection to the railway station would be possible.
The report concluded that it wasn't enough to conclude that the road conditions could lead to longer car occupants.
The responsibility for this is again on the city's part as a roadblock.
The builder may sue for damages in the future.
Since both the tyres and the abbots in the present state of repair weren't working, Haas argumentated.
At this place, the risk of a collision between a vehicle on the way to the station is significantly lower than that of the other train tracks because it's just opposite the stop-light, giving good visibility.
Even if you walk from the main station, it's already been spelunked to ensure that there isn't a collision.
The majority of the vote on this extension of the railway was voted down because the city council had to deal with the problem of standing cars so that the tracks could be reopened after the completion of the works.
When it's unproblematic in Greece, the carriages "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" were built on the tracks for the already frequented railway crossings.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom described pipelines in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new generation of gas.
Construction of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the Gazprom team.
The present event is a disaster: construction work on the bulgarian section of the South-Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began on Thursday, said the chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in an explanation.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
Southstream is supposed to provide more variety for Russia's export routes through Europe.
Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where the bulk of the Russian gas is stored, are worried about an increased risk on conventional routes, such as those from the official side.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, claimed that transit countries are always disposing of geopolitical barriers.
Bulgars will get gas from Southstream at discounted rates when the whole project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work on the route to the end of the year should begin in other ordered countries.
The pipeline has a capacity of 62,3 billion cubic meters per annum.
Airport Wien bans passengers from entering the airport.
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Because of this, it won't be possible to make the airport's shuttle service any longer.
A great deal of the loudspeakers are out of order - the noise is supposed to be so clear.
A relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this new initiative.
The way airport announcer Peter Kleemann was talking to Radio Vienna follows the airport's setting of departures, indicating an international trend.
Among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai have already given up on the noise.
By the way these tunnels - which average around 200 personal telephone calls a day through the loudspeakers - will become quieter at the airport in the future.
It has been proven from experience that these individual departures were relatively few, while all other information on changes in flight times or departure times was also taken into account, Kleemann told the radio talk.
Ben Greenman: Zehn years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker.
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: less than a hundred years ago, the comedian Frank Fay, who worked as a concessionaire at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, was working to get the crowd talking directly into laughter.
Fay's innovation took off over the years, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
In life called and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Stand Up Inc. Carolines, celebrates the festival's tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and big theatres.
Most of these headlines started at Caroline's, and then became successful until they were finally known to join a club, said Hirsch.
We organized this festival so we could work with them further.
At this year's event, Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy festival for veterans in Madison Square Garden, with performers including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The world of comedy is growing at the festival, too.
A number of comedians who are taking part in this year's festival have gone on to become more famous in unconventional ways, such as showings on smaller television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll was known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironically-spaced fantasy football series "The League" on FoxX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was in the mix of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," though she's best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Rolling Stones as well as Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, whose ironically focuses on the African-American W.C. Bell) are products of the dezentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest visitors is David Steinberg talking to Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but grew up to be a well-known television and film director, and developed into an inofficio comedy writer.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television show under the title "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting is taking place in the middle of Manhattan.
The town is invariably the result of Larry's entire work, said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he walks through the gap between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, I might get here.
Last August, the black-and-white museum of natural history in Gutach, near Hornberg, was again packed with children.
Traditionell, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, the 24 and 25 August, in the framework of the summer holiday programme, to a packed children's and family party with a host of activities and events.
Small and big can learn different old crafts in both days, says the press release.
Whether you're making candles, turning candles, ironing or sewing, there's something for everyone.
The children are helped by regional craftsmen from 11 to 17.
The museum's building is also being renovated.
When building from cannons, cannons or tyres, young guests can prove their handiwork to the craft.
A lot of fun are also promised by the many old games, such as karate or sledgerunning.
Speed and coordination are asked here.
Every Saturday and Sunday, between 12 and 14 p.m., the open-air museum offers a mystery tour through the museum.
Children have to guess which stories are true or not.
In addition, visitors have the unique opportunity to meet the free light museum while visiting the museum during a picnic with black-bellied birds.
Not only horses, but many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and hippopotamus are meeting and eating on the farm.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Ootsch on Sundays, which puts his bucket list with the museum's visitors starting at 11 a.m.
It's a pleasure and a pleasure to work with Hermann Bütner.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock.
In addition, the children's dance group starts from Gutach at 11.30.
On the other side of the coinciding between 11 and 17, there are plenty of craftsmen including weavers, seamen, spinners, weavers, bakers and bakers looking through their traditional work over the shoulder.
In Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum are expected to enjoy a varied holiday programme.
It is important for universities and companies to form a network.
On his visit to the Landkreis Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, vice-president Guido Wolf let himself know in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers will come from tomorrow.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he went with the head teachers of the vocational schools, the local councils and the principals on this important question.
Education is an important factor in the location of the school, said Claudia Stehle, head of the Hans-Thoma School, which set up the high-school education centre.
This showed that Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education.
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, the Kreisgymnas and the vocational school in the town.
In addition, he praised the family friendly in the area.
It's important not only to have the family phase in mind, but also the phase of care for the elderly, explained Wolf.
In addition, he found that he was always more stressed about the care and support of her relatives.
Without the support of the employer, the stress caused by the job can lead to a reduction in wages, said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he said.
A further, more important factor is the linkage of universities and companies.
Even though he had studied the history of the region while he was in college, his wealth of knowledge and his ability to manage the regional economy often contributes to the stability of the region, said the chairman of the committee.
Only if there were enough training opportunities, the demand for skilled workers could be met.
His opinion is that the geographical area of the Landkreis lies in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
In addition, he saw on his train from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg the already well-known demands for the improvement of the public transport system.
Continue to be hard at work and ensure that the public transport network is better, he said in response to the address of the present commissioner.
Australia is calling for action against prison sentences in Thailand.
A 21-year woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison for falsely claiming to be a taxi driver in Phuket was sentenced to 15 days in prison and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was arrested for a traffic violation in Phuket on June 15, after she complained to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had booked her for the weekend, the 10. Juni, while two other men were arrested.
However, later on in the recordings a video camera showed that she had come to her hotel after having been separated from her ex-boy.
The police in Phuket stopped Bamford for two days before she admitted that she'd been thinking of the story.
Until the trial, she was arrested in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in prison instead of being sentenced to life imprisonment for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, an ex-player of the Australian rugby league who asked for help from the Australian government for her daughter.
Tunk told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family were "extremely worried about his daughter's welfare and wanted to go back to Australia.
We're obviously very worried, but we hope she'll be back home as soon as possible, said Tunk.
Bamford appealed the decision and is on a free foot against a fine of 10,000 Baht.
According to reports in Australia, they were holidaying in Krabi while they were away on holiday.
From the hearing of the judge, Bamford will be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, and it was agreed that the prosecution could carry out a higher punishment for adults up to two years in prison.
However, it's possible that Thailand after the recent death of the traveller Michelle Smith in Phuket is trying to improve its badly-image as a tourist destination, and thus a freespruce comes.
The brickwork on the ceiling of the bell tower is painted in the dark.
A group of citizens' initiative "Sweeter Wiese" painted the wall mural on the corner of the Kurdistan promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
Aside from scrubbing and sweeping the footpath, they say it in a press release.
The demolition of the ruined houses in the back of the plot was not allowed on grounds of security, because the land threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who is renovating the plot now, had a dispute with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BBI about the property.
In advance of the action of the BI was a transparent message saying we were there.
However, about 20 members of the citizen initiative didn't get involved in their action.
Her motto on the large plaque read, "We are against bricks".
They wanted to warn about the danger of further rain on the Swiss plains - should the rice project be put off until one day.
Talking to a lot of passersby in front of the "Baustelle" it became obvious that some citizens believe that the implementation of the projects in the city will be much easier than before, even though not very many of the same questions concern the scope of the project presented.
But they're starting to sign because the city keeps refusing these answers, says the BI.
Just as to hear the mayor, turn out the public ovations of the mayor.
Mai, in the council meeting, he thought that he might be prudent for the thermal bath to ask the population to vote against plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss Alps.
Some people are so frightened that others perceive it as a "plumping attempt" to suppress the population, according to the press office.
The board thanked the donors for the paint and all the helpers.
Syrien has destroyed his possibility of producing atomic weapons, so a group of surveillance officers set up a watch group.
SYRIA destroyed important facilities for the production of chemicals and typhoons, said the global watch group for chemical warfare on Monday, while in the north of the country there were too many collisions between factories that produced highly toxic substances near the border.
On Thursday night, a Syrian Aktivist group announced that more than 120.000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Civil War, now nearly three years after it began.
The order of the Organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) came a day before the expiration of the meeting.
The Hague organisation Damascus set out on November 1st to destroy all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or make them "inoperable", ultimately all machines for the manufacture of chemicals and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this plan, which in fact brought about the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to end the destruction of all chemawabs by mid 2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syrien can't produce any new chemists.
Damascus must still begin to destroy the existing weapons and armor.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including penicillin and sarin.
The announcement came at a time when the city of Sfira held a protest against the coming of winter in which experts said that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses similar to those that were set up in Great Britain to promote human rights.
The Aktivist group, tracking the number of dead in Syria through a network of activists, announced on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
There were 61,067 civilians, making up 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 of them armed by President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were friendly to refugees and 187 libanese Hisbollah soldiers.
Among the dead were 2,202 deserted soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On July 25th, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict on 100.000.
This number hasn't been updated yet.
About two million people have fled the country because of the conflict.
Syrian rebels have been fighting in Syria for weeks against the Rebellen, whose many links to al-Qaida.
The watchdog said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but didn't give any details.
The battles underlie the threat posed by the Chemosphere, since their mission to liberate Syria from its gift of arms is a campaign against time in the middle of a bloody civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working with the United Nations, the team are "convinced that all Syrians saw important production and processing facilities and survived their destruction."
That's why there aren't any further inspections planned for now.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors said they'd completed the first round of inspections and visited the headquarters of Damascus on 21 of 23.
Because it was unsafe to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
The OPWC said the two sites were "offered," according to the syrical statement, and the facilities that were there were used to carry out the ChemoWaffen programme were put on hold by other organisations which were inspirated."
It wasn't immediately clear if the St. Patrick's Cathedral was one of the two that couldn't be visited by the OPCW inspectors.
Syrien has laid a plan for the complete destruction of his cactus, which will need to be carried out by the commission of experimentation next month.
"I wear the hat before the courage and the courage that you all showed in carrying out the most demanding mission ever undertaken by this organisation", said Ahmed Uzumcu, the general manager of the watchdog organisation in an opinion released by the OCW.
For the past three years, predominantly sun-stricken Muslim rebels in this civil war have fought against the Syrian government and their security forces, which many members of the Alawite opposed, an abduction of Islamic Islam.
In light of further developments, the head of the committee, Rami Abdurrahman, said a strong explosion in a air defence unit in the Syrian province of Latakia was taking place on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he explained.
RBS suspends two forex dealers.
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from their department of foreign trade, leaving two people familiar with the situation. This is another indication that the global ban on trade in goods and services is beginning to take hold.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they worked with the authorities on the regulation of the world's largest financial market, where every day 5,3 billion US dollars change hands.
The two men would be the first RBS workers suspended in the ongoing investigation that the Skandal is pulling out of the Libor exchange market.
The bank which refused to comment on the suspension confirmed this month that it received information requests from the authorities.
Our efforts on this subject continue, and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the bank two weeks ago.
Earlier this month, officials told close friends that the RBS had turned down the registration of emails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier retailer, while the Financial Conduct Authority, the watchdog for the UK, continued to investigate.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and by now, having retired from his current position as the European head of the Forex trade at JPMorgan, he was to be on vacation.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was laid off this week, and Matt Gardiner, who was previously head of the retail department at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
No one in this shop was hurt by any wrongdoing.
The group of instant messengers from Usher, a banker at Barclays and the Citigroup said that nearby people were in the situation.
UBS announced this week that they're taking steps against some of their employees after the Swiss regulator Finma declared that they were looking into a manipulation of the exchange market by a series of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, the Swiss Competition Authority, the FCA, the US Justice Ministry and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently engaged in investigations.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also received internal inquiries or information requests from the authorities, said familiar people.
Banks have been looking for cases of misconduct for several years by sending instant messages and emails.
The news about these investigations put the traders in a market that, in the past few years, was one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks, but this year it stood under pressure because the volatility of currencies limited the opportunities for specialisation.
Some bankers tried to play the lottery and said it was almost impossible to manipulate the highly liquid exchange market, but leading traders are of the opinion that it's not really true.
A leading broker noted that even though the volume of traded goods fluctuates daily between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of internal trading platforms by banks, it is already possible to influence the market with very low ticket prices.
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that a broker had cancelled her London exchange traded funds after having caused a loss of nearly six million dollars last year.
The bank informed the competent authorities promptly and worked with them.
We're sure that the thief dealt by himself and that the matter has been settled," said Credit Suisse.
Coulson used telephone hacking to spy on a tip.
The earlier news of the word editor Andy Coulson said in an attempt to correct a mistake in a tweet by the damsel interior minister Charles Clarke.
State attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court that News of the World reported in May 2005 that Clark had a relationship with his "attractive adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper asked the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, but Coulson called her and left messages as the judge did.
In the opinion of the cabinet, Coulson, now head of the cabinet, nobody stands in front of people and hopes to catch them up in the act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction", said Edis.
He said NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The doctor is personally involved in the third method.
Offensively, he knows from the second, the surveillance, that it can't be.
How about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies this, but we say: "Understand whether he knew about it."
The story of an angry Clarke first surfaced in the feature-report of NotW. When a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band of at least three telephones from her phone was put up in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
The investigators found, among other things, entries on the computer of the thief that were stored as "projects" on the Pawlby and her sister.
When the research was on, the greats received anonymous rings from Pawlby asking for information about them, explained Edis.
The former head of the department, Neville Thurlbeck, and the former reporter James Weatherup watched the movement from Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson sent a voicemail with the following subject: "I have a story we want to tell tomorrow that I'd like to talk about with Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities followed the same pattern as those of other important people, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The survivors heard that Coulson Blunkett was upset over an affair with a married woman when he was lying to the accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks say they had a crush on other people between the third of October 2000 and the ninth of August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup gave up the phone hacking.
Early puberty: Faster growth will be possible.
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to attain the puberty earlier than white agegenossens, as examinations show.
Changes in body shape don't directly correlate with puberty.
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemokalies are responsible.
Experts believe that obesity is a contributing factor to early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is less prominent among boys.
Pat Etheridge, former CNN correspondent, is a journalist specialising in child health and family matters.
Should a mother be worried when her daughter is already seven or eight when she's grown up?
At this year's annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the pediatrician Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and a new norm is being proposed.
I spend a lot of time talking to parents. It's normal for a sign to say that the puberty starts now, explained Kaplowitz.
Manifest displays of development, such as growing breasts, moustaches and Achilles tendons, show up earlier in girls.
Dennoch, there's only been a slight change in the age of the menopause (upsetting the first rule) in the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12,5 years, a little less than 12,75 in 1970.
When development of the bridge begins, it takes at least two to three years before menopause, said Kaplowitz, author of the book Early Puberty in Girls: The essential advisor to deal with this often encountered problem.
Time is the most exact test that can be put to the test.
Although it's unclear what actually causes the beginning of puberty, it's considered "failure" when a growth spurt is accompanied by a pregnancy at an age of eight.
In most cases, the process fails or stagnates – something that a child doctor can precisely monitor.
During rapid protests, tests could be carried out by an endikron to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or zysters.
Treatment methods for early menstruation and the prevention of another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which in turn can lead to small body fats in adults.
The recommendations for a medicine or hormone therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the growth rate and the emotional response.
Psychosocial aspects are equally important.
Kaplowitz is halting what medicines are giving, but he says something: Puberty can cause behaviour problems and feelings of girls to be milder than their peers.
The other big problem is obvious: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have periods.
You're worried about pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side, said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shame," recalls a woman who gave birth to her daughter at ten.
Even though it was the first sign and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She got anxious and excited to go home from school, because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are a lot of widely published theories about early puberty.
But there aren't any conclusive proof that hormones in milk or other foods, toxins in the environment or sexual messages in the media are harmful.
Boys are brought up in the same way that girls used to be in the puberty.
Kaplowitz thinks that the most convincing proposition is the Epidemie of Fate.
He supported the carrying out of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine, which examined the relationship between body fat and puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are a lot of other factors that play a role.
Afro-American and Hispanic girls in this country tend to be more attracted to puberty than white agegenossen.
There are different explanations for it.
Globally, it seems that all sorts of things play a role from the economic conditions to the genes.
Even though boys' facial and facial expressions have gotten older, the trend towards a full-blown early puberty isn't as prominent as it used to be in girls.
Other doctors present at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The rise of acclaim and shame is evident in babies and young children.
We have to be careful when we identify the true beginning of puberty, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents shouldn't hesitate to ask their child's doctor to advise them how they should talk to their child.
It may mean that you need to start a conversation earlier than you expect it to be, said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who get older need insurance to make the process a normal part of their life, if they enter early.
Illness: Two mountainbike races delight participants.
In glorious weather, 214 cyclists headed for Illmensee to take the cycle round the lake.
Ulrich Knobel is taking part in the annual Illmensee Sports Club.
In addition to the short distance of 15 and 300 meters, there were plenty of individual cyclists who once wanted to practise their hobby in a competition at the height of their own.
Two juniors competing in this race were also in the starting: Felix Bader from Baden-Baden and Pascal Treubel from Ach-Linz achieved good results on their recommendation in the German Meisterschafts.
They were able to set themselves apart on time from the field.
How in the past year, Felix Bader managed a short burst to reach his goal and defend his title as the overall winner of the short-distant.
On the second floor, it was possible to place another Pascal Treubel.
Theresa Duelli from the team Albtraum, who managed to climb all the stairs.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owings on seats two and three.
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only was the capacity to perform impressive, the whole range of sportsmen were represented.
Even the age structure spanned from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest stars.
There were even more absolute top athletes in the main races this year.
Four drivers were able to escape the regional top drivers.
Darn Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike racer from Black-Tusk Racing Team.
Pangerl was already two times world champion in a team sprint.
This year he was the European Champion in this discipline.
By doing that, Roland Ballerstedt, who already has two German championships in the duathlon, he's called his own.
After 45 km and 900 m, it came to a semi-final in the aim of the three-semester race.
Pangerl raced first over the line of goal.
Only a second later, the Routinier could secure the second place in the overall standings.
In the end, Hermann and Warthmann were third in the overall ranking.
Christian Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race in the Damen's race.
The second place secured the best-of-three spots for Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportlers and Helfers proved very satisfied with the uneventful and well-organized running of the event.
Israeli airstrikes target Syria, according to official sources.
Israeli airstrikes were targeting the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday, according to a senior government official.
The officer didn't explain what the purpose was, but it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, it was intended to target Russian SA-125 rifles.
At least two times this year has Israel already carried out air strikes on rockets in Syria.
Before the Battle of Varsovia, BVB-Anhängers with leitmotifs were setting up ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund imposed severe consequences on top of that.
The Ultras responded with a silence before the match on Friday against the VfB Stuttgart.
It was a strange, almost poetic Akustik, which the spectator before the match between the German champions Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park botched.
Most of the guests were singing their songs.
The southern suburbs, where the faithful stand - and the loudest - BVB supporters, presented themselves initially as unusually quiet: no songs, no banter.
The pod of capo, which would otherwise be used for the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
There was a big banner on the front of the podium with the slogan "Section stadium".
Only as a fiery Roman, even as the first BVB-player to win the cup, short-handed jubels were on display.
When his team's meeting followed, there was loud singing and weeping chants, but that wasn't everywhere by then.
In the central valleys 12, 13 and 14 there was nothing raining.
Even though the stadium's announcer Norbert Dickel recounted the positive experience of the past few days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by manager Jürgen Klopp - it didn't make for a party atmosphere.
Just five minutes before the start of the pitch, the crowd in a loud roar burst into a roar when, as usual, the atmosphere in the stadium turned bright red.
The last time there was the South Bridge in the row, and finally it was the loudest place in the stadium.
Not long after the South Tribüne's loud appeal for victory came, everything was the same again.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the noise of the past few days.
Unavoidably, in front of the home crowd at FC Salada 04, some of the injured BVB players were firing into the audience and onto the pitch - and on the way, almost twenty-thirty Roman drummers met the target.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had the tops of the Dortmund Ultra in his office up high and, as you might imagine, it was a far more humiliating meeting for the fans.
The BVB-Boss recorded a massive cut for the entire ultralight on Thursday night in front of a crowd in Frankfurt.
As part of the preparations, the Ultra recorded a song for the Heimspiel against the VfB Stuttgart.
"That's what I ordered", he said.
We can't tolerate nuclear weapons in regards to pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras offered several options of compromise – now until Tuesday, they have time to decide.
In case of such a thing, the BVB will issue a ban until the end of next week.
"That'll cut," said Watzke.
One should be anxious to see how the reaction on the southbound will turn out.
What's going on with my email?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Did the launch of the Internet service E-mail as technically as the usual post office be carried out?
In the concept of the early Internet services, it's important to make communication possible.
When it comes to basic technical prototyping, it's not enough to make a stable foundation for a reliable letter exchange.
A typical e-mail has sooner an open postcode than a lost letter.
When user "Anna" sends an email, are the computers of both parties directly connected?
Either the email program or Anna's browser sends in the first step the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
If she had, for example, a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This email server sends the content to the provider who uses Benni.
On this route, the mail can be accessed by any other server in the Internet.
Bennie can then telephone the contents of his provider.
Are all the e-mails on their way through the net read?
Most mails are read more often by software programmers.
The sender's usually checked to see whether the mail is a scam or not.
A virus check is being carried out on the receiver's systems.
A further check by the provider is whether it's a fake or unwelcome spam email that's going to be deleted immediately or at least in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another job?
In systems such as Gmail, the robots also know the information Google needs to organize its content.
If Anna and Benni communicate via email about their forthcoming holiday, Google can provide links to various holiday packages.
Do not even read people's emails?
The probability of intercepting a mail from non-fugitive people is extremely high.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the option of accepting electronic mail.
Even the police and the intelligence services have legal options to intercept emails or inform people.
There may be illegal activities to carry out.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from intercepting?
By encrypting an email in accordance with the OpenPGP standard, an email can be deciphered effectively against spam.
With a lot of technical effort, it's also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication so that it can't be recognized once without another person who shares it.
How important is Yahoo and Google in Germany?
In the most private postcodes, Yahoo and Google play an undergeordnet role, according to a survey by Convio Consulting in August 2013.
While Yahoo dropped its share, Google was able to clear up Gmail.
Germany's largest parish church has launched an offensive in order to kill the pastor.
A possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Hannover estimates that their number of pastors and pastors will be half the by 2030.
For young people today, the job is very attractive and promises a good future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the evangelical press service.
It's attractive to be able to make up your own mind about work and daily life.
For the first time in Burfien, a pastor has asked a pastor to hire young people for theology courses.
At the moment, less young people are choosing to study theology.
Burfien leads the way back to the process of reconciliation: "God's voice is low, the world is loud."
This is a profession of great freedom and diversity.
I am Mr. Myers's appointment book and can put my priorities there where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very helpful to people.
You earn as much as a teacher and could live well off it.
Strictly speaking, the free market will pay more, but theologians would have had a secure employer.
Young people are starting today, not only for money but also for a sinful job.
According to the local church, the three quarters of the Netherlands comprise about 60 pastors are retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 absolvents from a Theology course begin to live in Vikaria.
In sparsely populated areas such as Harrog, Emsland or the North West, it may be difficult to find jobs in the future.
Every year, colleges and universities organise a day of study for young people and invite prominent scholars to study theology.
The university of theology offers a broad curriculum.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA workers accused of sexually abusing Jonathan Lord have been arrested.
Two YMCA workers from New South Wales were arrested for sexually abusing children when 2011, protests against the head of the department of child protection Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were raised against the King's commission for sexually abusing children.
But in the opening statement before the commission, the Youth Ministry said that it had never ever been suspected of sexually transmitted child abuse in the organisation.
In one case, a YMCA worker was arrested for child pornography and in another, a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 was sentenced to life imprisonment for violating the law.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the commission's assistants, that he knew first but didn't know second.
He said the opening statement of the YMCA to the committee was insufficient in the claim that "the YMCA had carried out external checks in which the YMCA was recognized as a first-front in child safety".
The evidence before the commission shows much more that the YMCA said it received the second-highest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA when he was 21 when he entered the YMCA, dreamt that the management had gone "away from me" when Lord appointed him chairman, and wasn't sure that employees had been aware of their obligations to ensure children were safe.
Lord was sentenced to two years in prison for sexually abusing twelve boys while working for the YMCA for two years.
He was sentenced to six years in prison.
Hare claimed that the YMCA was a cultural problem, but the employees stopped talking about Lord's suggestion regarding child safety.
The employees said that they'd been neglectful of things, including that Lord had left them alone with children, leaving them as babysitters on his bench, telling one that he loved it, and let children play with his mobile.
Danielle Ockwell, who was the chairperson of the committee and asked for a dismissal against children's protection because she was worried about his behaviour, said the head teacher at the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who was the chairperson of the committee, was "very shy and was very unfriendly at the time".
The manager said he wouldn't accept statements made by employees, as they didn't know how to conduct themselves in order to hide their misconduct.
According to him, Lord revealed much more her friendship with Lord her judgments than why she didn't report him.
Hare said that he told the board of directors of the YMCA NSW that the decision to pull the organisation from the "Jonathan Lloyd-Levitt" didn't concern employees, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to ban employees from signing confidentiality obligations shortly after receipt of the apology was made by the head of the children's service at the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that it should be prevented from proving what was "overdue" and poorly done.
When Jonathan Lord was working there between 2009 and 2011, the YMCA NSW wasn't a safe organisation for children, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexually transmitted children, the commission.
He explained that there were "severe problems" with staffing, supervision, work, education and beautification.
The hearing was postponed until 20.12.
Tourismus: Ascended to the Romans.
The length of the canal is less than half that of Rome.
Those who visit Cologne don't come to the Dom.
The two towers in the sky span 157 metres, making them the second tallest building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigran towers anticipate that there's a lot to see under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the field of climate change.
The focal point for his leadership is the Service Center of the City of London, directly opposite the Dom.
The roundabout is completely unexpected: "We start at the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventy years the city council wanted to build a fair city, and in doing so, the rest of the old town council only stood to stand what wasn't too big.
The majority of park users rush to the red light today, leaving only their car behind.
But if you look closely, a fortified archeological site was found on the second floor of the park.
There are about five meter high rubbles made from hand-torn stones.
There are remnants of Roman forts built after Christus in the second half of the first century, says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight, participants at the top of the park should take a look at a shallow, 15 m deep crevice.
That's the bread of the old family, which unfortunately won't be realized.
The next station of the round is the Pretorium, and here the participants descend into the deep.
We are witness to the assembly of one of the most powerful mountains in the Northern Hemisphere, the chairperson of the CCAA.
What the CCAA means is that a visitor wants to know.
The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinium", meaning in good German "Stadium of Roman law and city of Agrippinus, founded under Emperor Claudius as the seat of the kings of Rome".
In the present, it's about the former Statue of Liberty, the Machtzentrum of the Roman Empire in the Rhine.
From the exhibition's entrance is a tunnel to the red-water canal, which runs about 120 metres.
You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want to, on behalf of the guests.
There's still a surprise.
After he's taken the key to the cupboard, he led the group to a 16 meter deep, well-worn trench.
We're in the Mikwe, a very dirty river, he says.
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the ground so that it would be able to hold the water needed for the ritual washing up.
Until today, at the end of the Mt. Sinai, where the Urals have gone back to eighteen, different water levels are possible through the changing pebbles of the Rhine.
The Mikwe is going to be part of an archeological zone on the site of the building works to begin in Curze.
But there are still a few years left before the final decision.
Land Rover Rally Series has been announced.
There are a number of meeting rooms and meeting rooms in the interieur, as well as a meeting room.
The options range from enhanced brems, a service package with support from bowling club mechanics and logistical support to the transport of vehicles between events.
Drew Bowler, manager of Bowler Motorsport, explained: "The rally dogs that come to bowling have changed."
They're not all experienced racers, they're people who are looking for excitement and money, and finding a way to world class universities.
We're glad to be in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and believe that the format opens up new possibilities for touring the different circuits in Britain and abroad, as well as enhancing the power of rallying and the strength of rallying.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge weapon – it'll become an affordable team.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February, as well as the option to take part in the World Championship in North Africa and the Nah of Osten.
George Kerevan: European elections give the Schottons the choice.
A new day, a new story of independence.
This time, we'll be warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the EU in the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty.
This is the key word for stories about crossings between Berwick and Hadrian's Walls along the Aegean Sea.
In fact, in the Strathclyde debate on the possible economic benefits of allowing more freedom of travel in rest of Europe, but that didn't make any difference – at least for the time being.
No one even mentioned that EU-member states often adopt strict rules when it's cheaper for them.
Since Scotland isn't currently in the Schengen Convention, the proposed ban on construction for Brussels would only be a modest change of direction in contrast to what it really wants from the Schottons.
No story at all.
And one who has come so far in the years that she's already a fossil: The first time I heard the phrase "Undependence means contempt for passports" in at least 40 years.
This is an interesting point when reviving this ancient story.
Why should you expect from an independent Scotland that it's similar to the European piper?
Why does the Londoner Joke clash with the Brussels crowd, especially now?
These are the real European news: the large, after the war, plan to unite Europe is in the stock.
The project Europe was officially abandoned by the European Union.
Across the EU, parties win seats on the ground that are ultimately EU-funded or the Euro is wanted to join the Union.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptical party alternative for Germany – founded just this year – had barely five million votes in the general election in September, effectively driving out the Liberal Democrats (in the same way as the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a secret resistance against the plan to create a socialist Europe.
The current economic crisis is, however, a turning point.
Because Berlin and the European Central Bank have a strict Sparpolitik in conjunction with the Shanghai Jack, in which the national economy of the country is expected to grow through the consolidation of the Währung, many people think that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments suffer from excessive budget deficits – only in Greece.
Statistically, the Eurosystem has notified its members of exchange rates which are favorable to German exporters – and that want to let German politicians do that.
Without the possibility of a decline in the local currency, South Europe with a lower productivity share is facing Germany again.
The only possible solution is to cut back on wages and expenditures – mostly from Berlin.
Behind the current shortage of labour and wages is a deepening problem of productivity in Europe.
As a result of the adoption of green energy directives by Brussels – a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies on the cost of the consumer – the European Union pays the double for electricity and the four times for gas.
It's a lower-cost alternative to what we could see in Grangemouth.
All conspiracy theories around the world don't protect the European petrochemical industry from being threatened by cheap US gas in the corners.
A revolt is taking place in response, especially in France, the undisputed leader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a bridge between Germany and Washington.
But Paris doesn't need Paris more than a platform for political legitimacy, and Europe has declared its own economic policy to fight the collapse of the French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-handed, EU-backed Front National has just won a decisive election and put the ruling socialists on the third spot.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that they can't afford to take advantage of a spread in the right direction.
What makes Le Pen so popular among the white French working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create an anti-EU and anti-government bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties win these elections – and that's very good possible – then they could dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
This is the point on which I want to focus: In not too far future will the growing anger against the EU and the commonwealth for the creation of the Euro come together.
The EU is not going to disappear, but it will become the "Europa of the (Soviet) Nations," which General de Gaulle promoted.
Germany and a few of its satellites may be watching the Euro, but France and South Europe will soon return their own currencies.
I expect that Britain's involvement in this project will make it possible for Britain to settle with the USA.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be able to survive the storm.
Where's Scotland at all?
We can decide to be a region of (in the end) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – how about telling Berlin and Brüssel what they can do to themselves.
I think Schottland could do quite well in a locker European Verbund, if we keep our own way.
Cooperation with other, similar-minded countries is easier in a not-for-profit Europe.
In the meantime, we should consider bringing it up in Norway and keeping our economic independence.
SNP in Scotland is, by far, the most successful political movement against the Sparta in Europe, and in 2011 a surprisingly large majority were achieved thanks to the elimination of the proposed (and defeated) coalitions that Labour's then-Labour minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Schottland to decide now for a independence only to get out of Berlin and into Brussels.
FAA: Air passengers can now use electronic devices in planes (without using mobile phones).
Traveling passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen and watch movies from the comfort of their mobile phone, as the new directives issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US on Thursday.
But the passengers shouldn't expect that these changes will be immediately implemented.
Depending on the specific airline, the FAA's liaison officer, Michael Huerta, told a press conference.
The airlines have to prove that the new rules are being followed and that they've updated the manuals of flight personnel and the rules for the use of the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said that she's already been approached by a few airline companies who want to make use of lightweight electronic devices in planes.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
According to the plans, we might soon adopt the use of electronic devices more widely," the FAA said in a statement.
At the moment, smartphones, tablets and other devices must be switched off when the airplane doors are shut.
You can't start them until they reach a height of three kilometres and the captain has green light.
When entering the country on a plane, the pilots must switch off again and can't start the plane while it is landing.
Following the new directives, airlines could allow operators of aircraft that are safe from electronic faults to use their passengers' devices at launch, landing and on the ground, said the FAA.
Most new transport planes and other flies that were designed to use Wi-Fi in larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, the president of the professional aviation association, welcomed the changes.
When the new rules are implemented and we work closely with the airline company, both sides will benefit," said Glading.
We're sorry to have to feel uncomfortable about this subject.
However, Internet connections for surfing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading of data under three kilometres were still prohibited, explained the authority.
Passengers are asked to bring smartphones, tablets and other devices into the plane.
Scrabble is similar to the popular online game played by actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone when he had to cancel the phone while the plane was in the alight.
Even heavier devices such as laptops need to be hacked, because there is a danger of falling through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The authority to regulate telephones is at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA may allow certain electronic devices to start and land.
Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board told CBS News that he thought mobile phones were still at risk.
Hands are really a problem, not only because they could cause potentially fatal accidents with navigation equipments, but because we know that transmitting from the air can affect transmission of signals", said Rosenker.
A committee of experts on this subject, which was set up by the FAA to investigate this subject last month, said that the government approved a wide use of personal electronic devices.
In the past few years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to bans on their use.
Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri say that there are no valid reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are becoming harder to enforce because the use of the devices has become more widespread.
In some studies, the report that goes beyond a third of the population to turn off the devices or ignore them.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices on flights in 1966 after reports of problems with navigation and communication equipments caused by passenger-operated UKW radios, which at that time were considered the latest technology trends.
New airplanes are far more dependent on electric systems than earlier generation of airframes, but they're designed and engineered by the FAA that they can't operate autonomously.
Airline passengers have been offering free Wi-Fi for a few years when the plane's height is reached.
Birds that are adapted to the Wi-Fi are less sensitive to interference.
The majority of passenger planes should be suitable for the heavier use of electronic devices, said Huerta.
The present generation of electronic devices generally have much less RF radiation than the earlier generation.
E-readers, for example, give only minimal resistance when you flip a page.
But when you download or send data, the transmission rates are stronger.
In the wake of a ban on the use of smartphones, Amazon.com lists it.
In 2011, company workers rented a pass-through printer full of Kindle readers and took a test flight to solve problems, but couldn't do anything about it.
Members of the FAA committee expressed their mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought that the devices were dangerous, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only mixed reports from pilots who reported a malfunction of the aircraft's engines, and most of them were very old.
The committee however encouraged the FAA to allow pilots to turn off instruments when there are poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adaptation for travellers who were equipped with modern technology today.
We're glad that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant journey doesn't compromise safety, said Roger Dow, president of the United States Travel Association.

Funnily paced activities attract enthusiastic hosts.
With a small cast, the men from the TSV Freudenstadt had to enter the battle of the bulls in revenge against the bowling ball of the WBC.
The elders, though, were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
It soon became clear, however, that they couldn't quite keep up with the rapid action of the joy cityers.
The snakes were extremely difficult to control with the harsh and dispersed attacks.
Strictly speaking, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleared the network of offensive attacks and scuffles, and were not present at the scene of the blockade.
Two high first sentences underscored clearly the popularity of joyous cities in all walks of life.
On account of this high-quality performance, the third sentence became a little dull and went down to zero (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, the TV Bairsbronn, who could clearly put themselves in Nagold, will face a much stronger opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannick Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Päller, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Klasse, the second team from Baierbronn and Freudenstadt were standing in front of the crowd at the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They won a hard-fought two-seat match.
Nervosity on both sides was especially evident in the ballads and penalty shootouts; even in the games, the preparation for the matches was too much fun, and in some critical match-ups, the referees prevented the player from winning any possible points.
This performance-highly deserved win in the TSV team was won by Marcus Blasutto, but it was achieved through the use of physical exertion and a friendly engagement between the teams.
Cats: No absolute protection is possible.
"We want to involve the residents early in planning," said Mayor Jens Häußler at the town hall's water-safety meeting.
Around 80 people came to the meeting room to discuss the planned measures, ask questions, express their thoughts and bring ideas.
Häuler clarified: The last decision is up to the members of the council.
The flood, which broke out on May 15, 2009, was a major event, the question of future protection measures being raised by so many.
A scoping exercise was carried out in cooperation with the neighbouring community, which now forms the basis for the high-water concept in Chechny.
"The aim of protecting the most beautiful land is to protect it", said one.
According to a German weather service, the plan of protection against floods was put in place for all 100 years to prevent flooding.
The change in climate will be achieved through a 15-pronged agreement.
In technical circles, this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The watermass that caused widespread damage in 2009 caused a 1000-year flood.
"There's no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said one.
To achieve the goal of protecting QE 100aKlima, around four million euros need to be invested in Geography, while the area's population can reach around 70 percent.
However, some insist that the promotion will only be possible if a comprehensive plan is implemented.
That's why the community voted on the impact of the citizens.
A thorough planning and approval process must be carried out.
In the best case, 2016 could begin with the implementation.
Under anderem is the protection plan presented in the community council last week (we reported) local measures against the flow of the river Irm from the Stammheim Tal.
In connection with the presentation of the high-water protection plan, the participants had the opportunity to present their concerns.
Under anderem, why weren't dams and ponds planned to protect the ortes?
Gregor Kühn, head of the team responsible for the design of the project, stressed that the combination of all proposed measures needed to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
On the other hand, the most economical solution was to be found, such as Joachim Wald and Corbe.
Mute prevailed among the oldorts who, like normal meteors, were always plagued by a collapse of the canals.
The problem is well known in the administration, and first steps have already been taken.
However, some critics argue that the guidelines for canal systems are different than those for high-water protection and won't be enforced.
The community is obliged to make the canal network so that it can be used for two to three years.
If you were to measure the surface of the ocean, millions would disappear.

Jumbo-Hersteller argue over seat widths in response to large orders.
There's a clash between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, which makes for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always the ones who try to lobby the airlines for the most, but this specially designed room is the key to the efficiency claims of the new planes of Airbus and Boeing Co.
Airbus has asked for a standard that requires cabin widths of at least 46 cm (18 Zoll) in the tourist class, but the US-based rival Boeing says it should be decided by the airlines.
The reunification comes at a moment when the aeronauts are planning to sell their two-motor long-range planes in larger quantities at the event from 17. November to 21. November.
How the back of the plane is designed – specifically whether there are nine or ten seats – is decisive for the economic results specified for the new "Mini-Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims that its modern "777X" seats 416 people in the class of tourists, which are over 17 feet wide and ten in total.
Airbus says the current version of the A350 can accommodate 350 people in 18-seat seats in the class of tourists, with a new generation.
Aircraft manufacturers often advertise technical details in the trade paper.
Airbus is calling at the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X will be running with over 100 orders, directly to the public.
Shortly, the company put up an advertisement warning about the beginning of a new advertising campaign and money-gebers showed a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, with the caption: "Would you accept this?"
Airbus is planning to introduce long-distance flights in seats that are smaller than regional turboprops, says John Leahy, executive vice president.
Compared to changing diets, people are getting fatter, but planes haven't changed at all.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, the average American between 40 and 49 years weighed ten percent, according to the US Census Bureau data.
According to the United States' health statistics, the mean height of the average American in the 21st century is 100 cm.
Airbus says its rival's seating scheme takes inspiration from the 1950s, when the average body mass of the newly-launched "Jet Set" was about the same.
Airbus carried out studies that showed that a further two inches (2,54 cm) would improve the sleeping quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the numbers of Airbus seats and says it's not in the interest of the manufacturer to decide how airlines manage the balance between flight and maintenance.
The company says, according to research, the experience of flying in a plane is affected by more than the width of the seats.
It really boils down to giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they need to do to succeed, says the aviation expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate what they do profitably.
You know her business better than anyone else does.
For air passengers, it's about more egg-freeze, but for manufacturers, it'll become a subject that can influence the amendments in increasing measure.
In the background of the reunification there is a rally of fighter jets with an estimated volume of about 700 billion US dollar in the next decade, which could have lasting effects on the export market of the United States or Europe.
For the first time since July, the layout of the meeting is the driving force behind the merger of the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing say they'll make 20 percent more efficient on their new two-speed trains than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeing's predictions about the results partly depend on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats in a row will be able to compete with the original design of the 777 by nine seats.
The cost of living per unit is still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.
By doing that, more seats in his planes are needed to make our products competitively cheaper, Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
Andererseits, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats on existing 777s said they thought that many passengers would opt for the cheaper option of flying by plane.
A seat width of eighteen inches would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, Airbus's offering is dominated by the 777, says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin operations, founder and co-founder of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jetsetters are taking measures to measure their performance against the competition.
Even though they offer the same level of comfort, all manufacturers still offer high-quality jets for domestic and regional flights.
Airbus is offering an A350 with ten seats, but according to their own statement hasn't sold any yet.
Airbus has recently stressed how important it is for cabins to be able to pass and some jets offer wide seats on the roofs.
Without the support of any other manufacturer, big modern jets say that the reputation for a new branch standard will probably disappear, but the well-being of 777X customers could be shattered.
Veganism, as the Lexicon says, differs from vegetarianism in a very significant way.
Since vegetarians are forbidden to eat sauce, ice or a strong salad, these meats are not allowed on the menu of vegans.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the prohibition against meat and fish, vegans are allowed to use all sorts of animal products - including honey.
What remains, one might ask, but closer to home, the vegan diet is characterised by a beach of inevitability.
Barbecues are very popular, says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the historic Reform House, which makes a wide variety of vegan-friendly products.
Even Reuben Proctor likes visiting the store in the dome.
Living vegan for 13 years, he finds almost everything he needs to live in Lampertheim. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian".
The next step was to take and I became vegan.
The proof wasn't just because of diet, but because of the shoe choice, says Proctor, an art dealer who specializes in normal leather.
He realized that there's no substitute for quality products in other everyday purchases.
Vegan in the first place is a vegetarian.
"I don't want animals to die for me", says Proctor the Maxim of Vegans, who are outraged at the whole consumption pattern.
Whether it was hamburgers, ravines or bears hiding behind, vegans quickly discovered completely new products, and the demand for them rose.
Proctor says it's a double bonus, saying that vegans aren't necessarily devoid of guilt, nor are vegetarians welcome, but rather a subset of the population. The assumption that eating options are rediculatory leads Proctor back to the power of the landlord.
And precisely these concessions allowed some even bogus attempts to succeed.
The factor of choice is a very important factor that can change the way you smoke a lot, according to Proctor.
And he says, "Best-trained mice aren't sticking to the animal".
Of course, it is the wines or the way in which they are prepared that change the taste.
"You can produce the same effect in another way," says the vegan.
Proctors like aubergines, champignons and a few vegans also bring to a barbecue.
He eats a well-balanced diet, which in turn should provide for some delicious meals.
Of course, something between the teeth is legitim.
It's supposed to comfort, but it's not just about reducing animal food, says Proctor.
In spite of the widespread claim of health damage, he hasn't responded.
For me, the transformation had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterin and have an increased vitamin D.
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan.
"My blood pressure is good, I often have to have it checked", says Proctor.
Especially in front of the man, vitamin B12 warns many vegans.
In order to feed the animals with fibres, it's doubtful whether the meat in the fridge is high in vitamin B12, says Proctor.
Vegans have the option of taking the coenzyme in tablet form.
His B12 wheels are fine, he says.
There's no need for proctors to go for the production of food.
There's some basic ingredients everywhere, and now every supermarket has soap and other products.
All I need is to find somewhere.
I'm only going to buy something special.
Some people forget that only the fermented products are expensive, but that's how it behaves in "normal" fermented products.
Vegan recipes are much cheaper and less time-consuming than conventional ones.
There's a lot of work to be found in the kitchen, and a few small knives can do a lot, but not necessarily produce better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little bit more acidic and carbonic acid instead of eggs, Proctor's vegan cheesecake was able to turn his sobriquet into a stink.
Vegans get a new taste from family feasts.
When you cook together, you get a new job.
The situations that can arise from this are as different as the people themselves, says Proctor.
Of course, he was brought up with the disease, but he was also introduced to scurvy.
Don't you eat my food anymore?
Do you want me to feel bad now because I drink milk? In such cases, vegans should approach with a fingertip attitude.
I don't let people down, I'm part of this company," says Proctor.
In a closer look, the everyday world isn't quite as vegan as you think it is, and vegans aren't restricted in their daily lives as much as they might think.
Fast food is allowed, too.
Pommes are everywhere!
Birds of prey offer falafels or even a vegetative yucca, says Proctor.
In a pizza restaurant he orders pasta or just orders pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to prepare.
When I started to become vegan 13 years ago, it was much more difficult than it used to be to convince the new-seekers that a development can be made: "You have to listen carefully to people who say that."
If there are enough questions, they might be inclined to add the menu, he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are opening, for example the cafe in Mannheim or the vegan restaurant.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan meal on the menu.
For the most part, vegan meals are eaten.
Everyone can eat them, but they're not exclusive.
Feasts are against indulgence, and in the true sense of the word, because they shut others out", says Proctor.
If you want to avoid food poisoning, veganism is a sure way to make the most impossible out of it, says Proctor.
But buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Even if you learn to use organic additives as a colouring agent in groundwater, it is easy to fall off the wagon when following the path of the ethik and falling off so many hills and bogs quickly.
Not only that, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book entitled "Veganesis - Animal Contents and Alternatives" explaining the many ingredients used in food but also cleaning agents.
Every now and then you develop a scanning technique and know which signs and logos to look for. "Sometimes small steps are better to do than standing still or being stolen," says Proctor.
Veganism is an important moral indicator that reflects consciousness.
He may not be entirely sure that he inherits his own house, but at least he can convince the general public to question his own habits.
Bayern's basketball team remained optimistic in spite of the first defeat.
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague couldn't dampen the enormous optimism of FC Bayern Munich's players.
No one can convince us to win even against the best team Europe has seen in the past two years", said Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after defeating Olympiakos Piräus in the final 83:88 (39:47).
We sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich, too!
Having just finished their third appearance in the European King's Council, they sold the coin purses long, but simply weren't clear enough for the decisive phases.
The guests first created the masterpiece, a 15-piece set 13 minutes before the end of a performance in a lead. Turning the game into a final act, the players unleashed again a melee.
We fought hard against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made another easy mistake, said Bayern captain Yassin Idbihi.
We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful players in the first two matches against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona Góra secured a clear victory.
New anti-nitrates could make the garlic smelly when you smoke.
Scientists have developed an anti-nitric oxide that could kill the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the medicine could kill mice for life.
Before tests on people will require several more attempts, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
We're very happy that this kind of vaccination can help millions of smokers quit smoking and, as a result, all the methods available on the market have been tested, but it has to be seen that their nicotine cravings are stronger than these approaches," said Cornell.
The new medicine contains a harmless virus, which has been altered so that it contains the gene information necessary to make anti-nuclear antibodies.
The virus infects the leukocytes which then produce a constant supply of antigens.
Antibodies jab the nicotin molecules in blood and neutralise them so they can reach the brain, whereby a smoker doesn't get a nicotine boost.
In experiments, pregnant mice were injected with Nikotin to lower their normal activity level.
If only mice could've taken an "extra time", the forscher explained, indicating that the nicotine in her brain had reached a certain level.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translation Medicine.
Back then, tobacco bombs were useless because they contained anti-bodies.
The vaccinations for the prevention of infectious diseases had to be carried out so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccines is likely to be significantly lower because he converts lethal acids into anti-cancer factories.
According to Professor Crystal, a future drug for people could be arose when he were absolutely certain that children would be able to use a cigarette and prevent it from being used.
Of course, it's likely that smokers would introduce him to stop smoking.
You know then: when they start smoking again, they don't feel like smoking because of the nicotine inhalant, and it helps them to change their habit", he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time, further research is needed.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot, despite its unusual production style and contemporaneous details, isn't as difficult as necessary.
The play in France of the 1760s tells the story of Suzanne, a young Adligen sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she confronts an extremist sadist upper class and is subject to a red stare from another.
The film never goes away in silence or sentiment – and that's the problem.
The ferocity of the story told in the film makes him an odd character for the audience.
Egypt defends first free-selected presidents in Egypt.
Mohammed Mursi leaves the bat, but his day of triumph isn't likely to end the political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "neutral Egypt" when he was the first free-suffering president of the country, and in doing so, Husni Mubarak announced that he had run out of power 16 months ago.
Mursi was also the first free-suffering islamist president in the Arab world, and Egypt's fifth president since the fall of the monarchy for about 60 years.
He laid the Eid in front of the 18 dressed judges of the court, whose seat on the bench is an antiquity.
We're working towards a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic, said Mursi at the party ceremony broadcast live on state television.
Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life: absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability, said the 60-year Mursi, a U.S. citizen and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group which was sharply opposed by the US government since it was founded 84 years ago.
Dogs of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building when Mursi briefly entered town at eleven o'clock in a small car park.
Only a few hundred supporters had assembled before the court to join the new president, and in contrast to the harsh punishment of President Mubarak, the traffic was stopped briefly so that the normally busy roads linking the city centre with the historic suburbs could be crossed.
As an unconstitutional "Ersatzrad" the fraternity has suffered a personal decline since his victory and a rally on Friday, in which not only he emerged as a candidate for Islam, but all the presenters presented the best results of the revolt from 2011 against the Mubarak regime.
Egypt is a zivilized, nationalist, democratically-religious state today, said Mursi, dressed in a red tie, covering the judge in the hollow where he put the weapons.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo where he should hold his protest.
He was officially welcomed by an army battalion, which played the national anthem, who stopped him in combat.
Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was greeted by hundreds of students in the largest auditorium of the university, shouting "the army and the people are a hand".
The University of Cairo founded in 1908 as a secular university, developing in the 1970s into a multicultural university.
Mursi laid a symbolic Eid on the Tahir Plate, the place where the Revolutionary Army last led to the end of the dictatorial regime Mubarak, on Friday, and he lobbied for the reinstatement of the executive order that the army had taken up from the Amtrak.
But with the adjournment of the tribunal and not as usual in front of the parliament, he urges the militia to carry on the fight.
Mursis's speech on the Tahir Plate was full dramatic populist chants.
Nogold: Hugo Wermter has been a choir member for 60 years.
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermster's story at the men's singing club Cäcilia was almost twice as long as the celebration of Herbsfest in which it was held.
Hubert Wermter stood up in the usual colours of his men's singing group on the stage.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with his beloved chorus.
The club's president was also active, becoming a member of the committee under the age of 28.
For his engagement and his volunteerism, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastor at the Catholic Church of Rotterdam, overreiched him - since the choir is a church choir - an apology to the congregation and a letter from Bischof Gebhard Forst signed honours.
His singing colleagues gave him the Ursula of the German Choral Association and a signed zinnette.
The 31. Augustfest was taking place on the MGV, the tracks of the Liederkranz, the singers' section Baisingen and the local music club: the full band loaded up a mix of different tunes and songs which entertained around 400 visitors.
The MGV Full Moon opened with enchanting songs like "It's a vineyard" and "Lust, her brother".
Her husband, Hubert Wermter, prepared for the honour of another small statue - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club performed the same classic songs as "Jägerweenie" by Julius Wengert, "We are far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you walk through the valley".
The singer-songwriter sorgte for his delicate chorus and his female group - the "Impulsor" - for the women's quote at the party.
The misunderstood chorus was brought to life by the neopolitan folk songs "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulsor" also took hold on foreign languages: "Liberty" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singers of the Baisinger Sportvereins came up with "What's the name of the club?" from Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back into a secret chamber where the full-time orchestra botched the famous finale.
There was a little programme for the children called "Oma Hanne" aka Hannelor Stoller, which opened a casper theatre and read some stories to the children about the lunch.
Frontier Airlines accepts baggage fees for baggage handling.
Frontier Airlines plans to lease up to 100 US dollars for passengers who want to use their baggage on the plane.
Frontier Airlines intends to pay up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and two dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if it was said in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole thing.
The new fee applies to baggage in the baggage compartment over the seat, but small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said you'll pay 25 US dollars if you pay the fee in advance and 100 US dollars if you pay the bill on your way.
Frontier writer Kate O'Malley said that the cost of 100 US dollars is intended to prevent travellers from paying themselves in advance.
"We don't want to add this sum", she explained.
Aircraft companies began to charge for the first and second consecutive days of baggage.
Passengers who tried to prevent this from happening have put their hands up as much as they could, resulting in the frequent overflow of baggage over the seat.
Taxes are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee doesn't really allow you to earn money.
It's about the loyal customers of Frontier who pointed out that it's always harder to find a seat in the team.
Passengers who buy tickets on the website of the airline don't have to pay.
That means that a passenger on the Frontier flight may take a baggage allowance under circumstances, but the next person must pay 100 dollars for a similar baggage allowance.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and the check-in procedure would be changed so that passengers could know about the fee so they could get to the airport.
Frontier's new hand baggage fee doesn't go into effect until the summer, but there's no precise date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other fees, but airlines often use it to bring back passengers.
They argue that the transport of baggage is expensive and passengers should pay for this service if they knew it.
Many on Wall Street interpreted the new fees as proof that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of flights after years of loss.
The majority of people don't let their fingers get wet for handwashing.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded to be the first to charge for baggage handling three years ago, followed by Allgiant Air, which also carried a baggage claim.
The only other airline with a similar fee was the Hungarian Airline, said the executive director of the airline, Jay Sorensen, who monitored the extra charges.
He estimated in a report from December 2011 that the cost of handling baggage is 50 million US dollars annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown in spirit and was curious about what he would expect on board the plane if passengers were confronted with the unusual baggage fee of the company.
The procedure for boarding was one of the most humiliating experiences I've ever experienced on a train in the air.
I expected to see teeth whitening and hand-to-hand discussion on the flight deck.
The plane was full, he said, and the board slammed.
Frontier also gives Spirit for the two dollars that are required for coffee, tea, limonade or soda.
The company said that if you buy lemon or liqueur, the whole dosage would be kept and coffee would be filled for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had tried for a short time to raise money for emergency relief, but seven months later it was back on its feet, having complained about the loss of passengers and no other large company.
Frontiers in levying fees for baggage handling when passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline is the latest initiative to be directed to the customer's own website.
Airplanes pay online retailers like Avis 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to buy airline tickets direct from them instead of a paper-based store.
Frontiers have been made in this area, but not far from it.
In September, the company began to book more than half as many flights a day through an online reservation agency.
The miles were again cut to 25 percent on the route on Wednesday.
A trip on a budget airline with Frontier that costs more than 1,000 miles, therefore, only 250 miles.
Passengers can book places only through the direct sale on the website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at his headquarters in Denver, but the business is down and the company is losing money.
The elixir went back by nine percent, and the number of passengers on board was barely 13 percent in the first quarter, as it was reported in the financial report issued by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic tried to take control of the finances of the company through the sale of the company.

For national and international investors, the market for real estate in Germany is out of reach.
The economic conditions are right, and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This is the last of the nine eras of the Berlin Wall.
German developers benefit from the strength of their economy and the relatively good conjunctival conditions in the country.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, the North East and Africa from Jones Lang LaSalle, told the 9.
When looking for German industrial workers, look at the volume of transactions, such as Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it dropped by 31% compared with the same period last year.
In Britain, the plus was only 6%, while in France it was 19%.
Investments in real estate offer an attractive return, said Ulbrich.
The relationship between real estate and government bonds is on a historically high level.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe that death will come.
The parents of the teenagers who were found hiding in a crowd at his high school are convinced that their son was murdered, explained the lawyer to the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US-State of Georgia was arrested on January 11, 2011, in a fair trial, standing behind the bench in the school cafeteria.
The investigators from Lowndes County came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old did not.
They're convinced that their son was murdered, said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never would've thought that he was as dead as the policeman thought he was.
You're of the opinion that every logic goes against the laws of physics as well as healthy human beings," said Crump.
Much more than they were convinced that the truth will be hidden to protect the person or persons responsible for her son's death.
His son went to school to study and came back in the sack, he says.
US attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he'll give a formal apology to President Johnson, as a number of important questions remain unsolved.
What was the cause of the death?
Is death on account of a crime?
That was explained by Moore at a press conference on Thursday night.
I follow the facts in which they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
I reject the view that there is a sufficient basis for a formal apology, he said.
Moore told reporters who were driving the first-hand car claimed that Johnson was suffering from a "position-induced injury".
A second car has a similar ton of tos, such as Moore.
There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," said he.
Moore added that if there are enough evidence to warrant a criminal prosecution of Tod Johnson, the FBI will be charged with carrying out the investigation.
A representative of the county sheriff was not immediately ready to respond to our request on Thursday.

John Kerry declared in a mock statement that he thought the US spying was "uncontrollably far away".
John Kerry pledged a non-proliferation stand of the United States in relation to its surveillance program, saying that spying had gone too far in certain cases.
The foreign minister said that he and Barack Obama were responsible for turning on the "autopilot" when the explosive revelations by whistleblower Edward Snow about the spying activities of the NSA became public.
Through the gathered information, the United States is in a diplomatic storm of embarrassment from their allies.
In a videoconference at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "In no doubt, the President and I as well as other members of the government have found out about some things which were almost impossible to do because of the fact that the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War were still going on, as well as the 11. September."
After declaring himself the first senior member of the US government to have crossed the border on US spying, he also stressed that no right was violated.
He said: "In some cases, that's not fair enough."
The president is determined to raise awareness, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that nobody feels guilty about finding fault here.
I'm sure that the rightfully innocent people in this process won't be harmed.
Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force for good, and through her surveillance plan, many lives were saved.
He added: "We've got to do with a new world where people are willing to plunge themselves into the air."
There's a radical extremism in the world, which aims to kill people, take fire in the air and attack governments.
What if you were able to stop this and stop it before it happened?
We actually prevented bombings, attacks on buildings and deaths of people because we learned about such plans in advance.
Under those, US-American legislators travel to Europe to fight against the growing threat of American spying and to convince the Europeans that they will continue to work with the USA in the fight against terrorist acts, as the chairperson of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was worried because they were afraid that the National Security Agency is refusing to cooperate with anti-terrorism organisations because of the failure to monitor the surveillance of the United States.
It's very important for the national security agency to keep the Europeans on board when it comes to our joint efforts against terrorism, said Murphy, who sits in Senat and is chairperson of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs in an interview in Washington.
Außerdem, I'm going to Europe to make sure that we continue to work on counterterrorism, noting her fears about the NSA program.
Even though the NSA collected millions of telephone data in Europe, reports on relations between some US-backed organisations were undermined when the head of the intelligence service declared that the reports were inconvenient and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO and exchanged with the United States.
Other enthousias stemming from the leak of documents further revealed that the NSA was monitoring the mobile phone of German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the surveillance of 34 other state-owned policemen worldwide.
The head of the national security service, James Clapper, declared that spies were necessary and explained that it was usual on both sides.
All in all, Murphy said his committee is planning to organize the conference that will take place this year, and hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participants should be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "more serious words".
He said that the European governments should be honest about the way they've been running spying programmes for years.
While we can change our surveillance programme and protect the rights of the Europeans, it also needs to be realized that we are not the only ones spying on them, says Murphy.
John Kerry is going on a trip to the far east and to Poland at the weekend to discuss the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US-US cooperation.
Dreams of children will come true.
The orphans and children's centres in the zoo will get posts in these days.
The black-walled botanics want to collaborate with the Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb to support their wish for building and beautification.
Do the kindergarten need a new bucket of sand?
With the help of the action, all children aged five and under can be rescued from the entire zoo.
If you've got a wish for improvement or renovation of your building, you can apply this to the black-water botanist.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the kindergarten fund.
A jury made up of representatives from black-women botany, the building industry and the symphony Zollernalb select three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be made up of building materials worth at least 2000 euros and a (activity-) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to look after a lot of expensive buildings.
What's wrong with the action day and the volunteers?
Building house is putting the material to use with the help of the spark station.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on day one and then processed by the workers.
Helfers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the children themselves.
Clive Palmer claims Tony Abbott has an interest group on his parents' holiday.
The Milliardaire and Abgeordnete Clive Palmer says that Premier Tony Abbott is engaged in an interest group over his plans for a family holiday because his daughters could benefit from it.
The mountaineer, who is in a bitter dispute over the payment of six million dollars for CO2 emissions, raised the claim as though he wanted to know whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate on whether the carbon tax will be cut or slashed.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have influence, and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the legislation.
When it comes to paid parental leave, he has a direct interest whether she gets paid or not, said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the polling commission in Palmer declared with 53 votes the winner of the Sunshine Coast contest from Fairfax.
Palmer called for a review of the process so that it could be used faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters France and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the referendum?
We need a better system, said he.
Why don't we need a system to store the data in a computer immediately and then at 6:30 p.m.
Palmer also criticised the use of bleach when marking the stamps.
Do you use it because you can then translate the results if you don't like one?
It's unbelievable today to be able to do that in pencil.
The election commission has checked the options for an electronic election, and recently a joint resolution proposal with New Zealand was published.
Palmer, 59, said that he hears about an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he'll take his new airport seriously.
In a public space, it is used to provide the service to the public.

ESA decides on large space missions: missions for billions of dollars.
Faraway planets, gravitational fields or black holes - experts at the European Space Agency have to focus now on two large projects they want to start in the next few years.
There were 30 proposals, but five are still in the race.
Faraway worlds.
More than 1000 planets have already been found in other stars.
No one knows for certain whether there are any of them or not.
It's hard to choose: Do you want to look for gravity-induced swelling?
Is it better to water the source of the cosmos or to raise the bar?
Or do you look for strange planets and discover other life?
These questions pose the heads of the European space agency Esa.
Their program "Cosmic Vision" seeks ideas for two major space projects that should be the focus of the research.
The average cost of such "L-Missions" is about one million euros.
The start will be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of the European space agency met in Paris to discuss proposals for missions.
There were 30 ideas in the debate, but five of them are now in the general election.
Numerous Gremies assess the proposals, looking for them at the fork.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the scientific committee.
Insgesamt four big questions have been asked by the ESA, which are supposed to answer the "Cosmic Vision" mission launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for the extinction of planets and life?
The exact sequences of the Entstehung of stars from large galactic galaxies and thus the Entstehung of planets orbiting these stars remain in perpetual darkness.
A big infrarot telescope in all might pierce this dark.
And if there's a constellation of stars, under what circumstances can life exist there?
To answer this question, the 2017 space telescope "Cheops" should begin with the 500 already known planets in our vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, but Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With bigger instruments, the astronomers could depict distant planets and analyse their atmospheres, looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be biologically active.
How does the sun work?
Even this question should eventually be decided on what conditions exist for the survival of life.
A significant role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field with the planet.
In our solar system, we can model these phenomena by looking at them.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the ESA already has a mission to the MK (the budget for this question is about half a million euros).
The sun should start in 2017 and the surface and activity of the sun should be closely watched.
A great deal of interest for the Forsaken are Jupiter and his Monde.
They want to find out what role the solar system played in the development of the solar system.
That makes the Esa the first of the three LMS "Cosmic Vision" programmes.
The son "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) will begin her journey in 2022.
A few years later she reached Jupiter, and she's supposed to explore the planets as well as the eisen Monde Europa, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the fundamental physics of the universe?
The world offers a lot of opportunities to study medicine under extreme conditions and to find out whether the well-known laws of nature still apply there.
Perhaps there are some abductions that could lead scientists to a new theory by combining all the well-known laws of nature under one roof.
How did the universe come up and what is it?
Our planet was shattered by the sun 13,7 billion years ago.
Apart from our abundant materie of stars, planets and living beings, there are Dunkle Materie, whose Schwerkraft Galaxie and Galaxie collide, and Dunkle Energy, which accelerates the expansion of the world all.
Until now, the forschers don't know what physical sequences were valid in the first few seconds of the eruption of the Uranium, nor do they know how to make light and dark energy.
Eurasian has already approved a M-Mission to start in 2020.
By using a special telescope, the Sonde will examine the distribution of materials in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and determine the stability of dense materials and dune energy.
Who could do the races?
Of the 30 proposals, only two remain at the end of the selection process.
In the opinion of a lot of experts, "E-Lisa", a rigorous approach to the study of gravity.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They weren't told until today.
Elisa could do that, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission is looking for a team of two or three senior officers who will be stationed in all.
In addition to existing gravitywells on the earth, which were formed during the Uranium, he could prove new insights about the evolution of the cosmos.
Four more proposals are being proposed for the second L-Mission: a large telescope called "Athena", which is supposed to monitor the outer planets of the Sun, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will find and locate distant planets.
There are, among others, proposals for the reunification of Mars to the Moon, Venus and Asteroids, as well as for the study of solar radiation.
The CDC released guidelines for school lunches.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a series of guidelines for the handling of food allergies in schools on Wednesday.
These are the first such directives that the US government has issued, since the number of school-aged children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States is allergic to food now.
According to the CDC, the number of children who are allergic to food increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The textbooks contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies in the classroom and staff, and how they should be handled to reduce allergic reactions among children.
It's recommended that schools take precautions against echinacea – the auto-injection of the mark EpiPen is the most commonly used to prevent a potentially fatal reaction.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to keep their eggs fresh.
There's also a list of typical symptoms, which are named by children, that indicate an allergic reaction.
Children might say: "I feel as if something's pressing on my tongue", "My tongue feels as though there's a hair on it" or "My tongue is brittle."
A firefighter called to rescue a hedgehog when it fell 15 metres across the ground into a dangerous rock.
Ruby was run over by a minor traffic accident.
A few days later, she was discovered by a stonemason in her misfortunes.
Firefighters stormed to the edge of the forest, setting fire to the dog before his death.
The fire brigade tried to put a dog at risk by placing a 15 m high jump in a rock wall.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cockerel chicken, was run down by a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and lived for three days alone before she was rescued by a fire on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who were listening to the dog, went to a firefight in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to help Ruby recover from her embarrassment and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were desperate for their missing chickens and called for help in social networks when they had run into a small traffic accident in the town.
A little before 14:15 on Wednesday, a walker who was running after his dog found Ruby stuck in the 15 meter high pile.
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station quickly arrived and set off to rescue Rubys which then were transported by a dog box up to the top.
Andy Clayton, technical rescuer, said: "She was in danger."
She climbed up to the top of the rock, 15 metres from the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her recovery – she was as frozen as ice.
But now she's all right.
She then fed a few dogs.
It was quite unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, technical rescuer, said: "Ruby had a rough time."
There was the possibility that she would be very badly hurt or drowned.
Ruby was taken to a vet for an exam, but apart from pneumonia and dehydration, nothing was confirmed.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Being able to see the scene was frightening."
I couldn't believe she really was there.
It was wonderful to keep her in the arms again.
The vet said if the disease had grown too big and they'd collapsed, they would probably have died.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so thankful, and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley said: "We were afraid she would fall, but she stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can scarcely believe where she was.
US-Grenze: "Supertune" to potholes discovered.
At the border between Mexico and the United States, explorers discovered a "super-tunnel" of poisonous snakes and kept it.
As the US government explained, the more than 500 meter long railway line between Tijuana and San Diego was fitted with electrics, trams and an air conditioning station.
Three suspects were arrested the night, eight tons of marihuana and almost 150 kilograms of coke were seized.
According to the report, the tunnel wasn't yet used.
The goats are stupid if they thought that they could cross over the radar, said the secretary of state for Southern California Laura Duffy in front of a press conference in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel was discovered.
Duffy assured the crowd that if you continue to build this tunnel and try to use it, we've decided to make it into a huge waste of money.
Both the US troops and the Mexican security forces are engaged in a prolonged conflict against the drug cartels.
In Mexico, more than 77. 000 people have been killed in connection with drug trafficking since 2006.
Experts agree on the issue.
Because of the elaborate construction of the tunnels, the builders claim that he was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place over a year.
The shed was so equipped that electric vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side, there's access to a building about 80 meters away from the border.
According to the authorities, a bridge 20 meters deep is actually going to the tunnel.
The tunnel has a length of 1,20 metres and 90 centimetres.
He would've been able to do that, too, to promote the illegal immigration into the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the crime.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for possession of marijuana.
All three men threaten lifelong freedom, as officials said.
Eight of the tunnels have been discovered since 2006, according to the press conference in San Diego.
It's the first time that a cobblestone has been found in a tunnel.
Kokain is usually smashed in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "waning" of drug dealers who have cut down traditional routes in the past, said Bill Sherman of the Drug Enforcement Agency in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the USA.
Not a single detail was revealed at the gathering, but one Mexican named it.
You have to count your chickens by ten.
Obama's return to health policy was welcomed by the public.
After heavy criticism, President Obama made a rebuttal in his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After receiving a notice of resignation from their pledgers, the presidents of the republics have said in the past few days that they've let the American public down.
Yesterday, Obama made up his original promise.
The majority of the people who have a working insurance policy can keep it, he said in a speech in Boston.
During reaction to the numerous media reports about the terminations, Obama called on the American people who received these letters to join the free market for a new insurance policy.
Most people could get a better, comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
They'll make a better offer, said he.
The government said it was little surprising that five percent of the population who have already signed a policy need to look at another tariff because their contract does not include the new standards for Affordable Care Act.
I just want to tell these Americans that you deserve it, said Sebelius in front of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sally, who is responsible for the implementation of Affordable Care Act, said the start of the online platform has been "unusual" since October.
I'm as frustrated and angry as everyone else is," she said.
I'm determined to win back your trust.
A lawsuit brought by a former Sebelius to a lawyer in the hearing of her sitting advisor at the Republican convention house was taken up after a meeting with the republican executive Billy Long from Missouri about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius reexamines why the "architect" of Affordable Care Act didn't agree to a publicly funded insurance policy in order to settle a rate at HealthCare.gov that they now want to sell to millions of Americans.
Parents of intersexual children can "not vote" for gay children.
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender of children born without any clear genetics.
Newbies aren't allowed to star in the mirror anymore.
Parents must not explain gender to these children after the new law, but can "unbestow" or "not set" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the session is to put pressure on parents so that they don't have to make sudden decisions about whether or not to adopt a sexual orientation in children, and to fight discrimination against transsexual people.
An intersexual person told BBC years later: "I'm neither man nor woman."
I'll keep the flickr that was made by doctors hidden and full of grief.
According to statistics, one thousand children are born each year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They're part of the intersexuality, a group of people diagnosed with the diagnosis of sexually transmitted diseases (SDHD) who develop atypical chromosomes, erectiles (epidermal cells or genitals abnormally developed.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexually engaged.
The understanding of gender identity is still not very well developed, but most experts in the USA say that they advise using the best available information for gender identification when there's no agreement, and not on the psychological and physical development of the child, so it's that one decides whether to undertake an operation or not.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who is specialising in gender identity, said the new German law "is a good thing".
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
Some people have serious illnesses that require surgery, but most children don't.
You can make a marriage proposal without an operation and then wait to see how it affects your identity.
The scientific data on how a child develops its social identity aren't very precise.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like a secret why people are homosexual.
In a report by the European Commission of the year 2011 it is said that transsexual people are different from transsexuals because their status isn't directly related to gender, but rather through their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively masculine nor female, but distinctively both distinct from one another or not clearly defined as such.
These characteristics manifest themselves in ad-hoc sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, body fat, or hormones, or in cellular structures and hormones.
The report gives an overview of the discrimination against transgender people in the workplace, as well as the extent of bullying, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't fit the gender stereotype now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it's possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to declare their gender on official documents, whether they are male or female.
In June, Australia's Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "undocumented" person after a court agreed to the living standards of a "non-defined" gender.
Deutsche Ausweise have in future a third directive, X for intersexual, so the interior ministry.
In the newly minted French, there's still a lot of bisexuals out there, as a news report on France 24.
In 2011, the head of the department of justice of the strict catholic country signed a petition asking that the "Geography" be removed from schoolbooks.
The US-based website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, with the argument that if the world is going to be in a new state where the decision on gender affects sexual activity but not sexual activity, then we will have two more segments of civilisation."
A mother of a new baby from Maryland told Baby Zone that she thought it was better if babies were given genders at birth.
The parental leave isn't stressed enough, especially if you don't know the gender of the child in question," she said on the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
History saw children born both to males and to females, called hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God that both genders had.
Until ten years ago, medicine considered the gender as something to lose and then rebuild.
But in the meantime, the ethical basis for an operation is being debated, as it is now known how complex the sex is, and doctors can be wrong, because they don't know how the child feels when growing up with the other gender.
In the 20th century, there was a "psychological crisis"," said Drescher.
When a child is born like that, you don't call the psychiatrist but the doctor.
The debate about the treatment of children with no clearly defined genders is centred on Dr. John Money from John Hopkins University, who insisted that gender is formable.
He defined the term "geographical identity" and argumentative approaches to social and environmental issues, such as parents rearrange a child, interacted with the genes and hormones of a child, and pretended to be male or female.
But in the fall of 1966, under the name John/Joe, his theories were challenged.
He told parents that a boy's penis had been cut off in a cruel way so as to kill the child, remove his hooves and then become adults.
"Money presented this fall as a successful example of a change of mind that he had not been able to do," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he turned back to masculine gender and married a wife.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to doctors, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, these sexually transmitted diseases were endemic to the public, who were "not happy with the result".
That's how Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY-mänchy chromosomes, but two teenage daughters.
The doctors weren't sure whether he had a big crush on a small pen and were convinced that he could never lead a happy life as a man.
Shortly after birth 1976, his external organ and the host were surgically removed and he was brought up as a child.
When he was 12 years old, he got the usual hormones.
I knew I wasn't a girl, he told ABCNews.com.
I was unlucky, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should get a vaginal surgery.
But as he was saddened and knew something wasn't right, he asked for his medical approval.
What he did was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, because his body couldn't produce enough testosterone for the development of the genes.
After finding out the truth, he turned back to his masculine identity and removed his breast.
Through the operation, he became impotent.
Today, he's fighting for others in an organisation called the Interface Project to make people who are intersexual normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the in-country legal group Advocates for informed choice, worried that the German law could be amended "to protect against discrimination and discrimination".
Young activists are worried that the German decision makers could make quick decisions and adopt a ‘non-determined’ child, she said.
We're afraid it will cost more to intervene.
We think it'd be better to show off the male or female gender and then wait for it.
But we don't yet know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports the Australian law, because "it gives adults the recognition of being a third gender".
Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender, she said.
In the German law, consent is required at birth.
It's not a fight to have young children at this age.
When they grow up, they can decide themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast specialist from Pittsburg who helped a daughter with a sexually transmitted disorder and several others in a self-help group, says the German law is "fulfilling" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a full androgen receptor.
Because of the receptor deficiency, Katie developed distinctive character traits.
She has a chest, but no upper body and no cheeks.
Today is Katie, 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff member in the child mental health department.
She's unproductive, but she hopes to get a child through adoption or adoption.
The law gives parents space not to make decisions, said Baratz.
They've lost the time to do different tests and clarify things, leaving them so free to write "manly" or "officially".
It's all right in this way: you take the baby big and love it.
One has a wonderful baby and enjoys the happiness of parents.
And you don't have to rush an operation that can't be repeated.
The decision is made by the children, and the parents are relieved of the fear that they wouldn't do the right thing, she explained.
In the end, the child decides the gender that best suits him – and that's wonderful.
Children are more likely to make decisions themselves.
Extensively, the battle was won.
The role of Santiago, the old man in the novel "The old man and the sea", is cut by Horst Janson on the leash.
Janson is an alter ego in his art, acting.
The old man Santiago can't make anything out about fishing.
Those two things just add up nicely.
It's almost as though the falcons in the old man, speaking of the fishermen's manolo, can be seen.
If Santiago suffers from a lack of rest on his chair, that's true at Janson.
Daneben is the role of the old fisherman through and through a character that Janson masters perfectly.
Hemingway told the story of a hunter, a courageous man who doesn't give up, and finally through his knowledge and his will to strengthen the fight against fish.
Janson is on the stage as an all-rounder.
He manages to attract the attention of the public so that his monologue isn't boring at all.
His efforts to catch fish at the surface of the water are so intense that spectators forget that the sea is just a pale blue.
Regisseur Jens Hasselmann lets the old man in the boat before the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the spotlight on the most active scenes: the Hütte of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings her song and her splendid voice the feeling of belonging.
The four musicians play the flute and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Do you like ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British company has developed the first light-filled ice cube with the help of collets.
Charlie Francis nutted the fluorescence of the sea and created a brightly lit candle.
The idea came after he read a research paper on quarantines and Chinese scientists were able to convince the light protein to be useful.
The ice cream reacts during digestion with the reaction of the pH in the protein, and the leucocytes are dispersed.
Chris says the food reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights – the more you laugh, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: The product is incredible, but it's still in a very early stage of production, so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the gas in a neutral pH.
When the body digests the protein, the pH rises and the ice melts.
We've tested it in the past few months, and it seemed perfect for us to put it on the market at Halloween because it had this wonderful effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the polymer is four times cheaper than gold.
Each cup of tea costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company with headquarters in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes of beer, cheese, beef and leafy vegetables.
But his new style is said to be even ambitionier.
He says: "I'd like to develop an unseen ice cream."
It's impossible because of the light pollution caused by the ice cream, but I guess we'll find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescence characteristics of a col, which are produced by Chinese scientists.
Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ukrainian Conversations Forum.
In the next U.S.A. discussion forum on Monday, 21 October, in the new museum of the castle will be the subject of "Halloween and Hell - Theological debates to contemporary dealing with the last".
Refere is Professor Johna Rahner.
The Ukrainian Conversations Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical church communities, the Salem Castle and the Cultural Arts Council.
Johanna Rahner is going to ask the question whether today's people are doing the "last thing" after death.
If people have known too much about past centuries, and thus on those images of heaven and hell, "that we deem to be our own imaginations till today", the prophetic lessons from the hope of fullness through a certain discontent or even lack of language emerge.
The referent says the greater hope is that Christians and Christs have been influenced by religionskriticism.
She's worried because there are so many question marks that we couldn't get hold of the telephone numbers.
John Rahner continues: "When the decisive challenge remains the fear of death."
That's why some people ask, "who dream that at the end everything will be OK".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied anthropology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert Ludwig University Freiburg.
She went to Dr. theo in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The doctorate in fundamental theory and anthropology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelmsuniversity.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been in charge of the department of systematic theory at the University of Kiel.
Hedgehogs: There's a cure for wedding hairstyles.
The ehe is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake, said the philosopher Sör Kierkegaard.
As far as the wedding party goes, there's a special event in Hinge in the Dom.
There were a lot of important suppliers around a wedding.
A trend: Retro looks are back in fashion.
It usually starts at the wedding dress rehearsal.
White is a must, best laid or in cremation.
Strictly speaking, and with ironclad garments closed, often with a tie. Backwards, they tend to go down the back and end in a tie.
However, the spirits differ as Stefanie Koch explains from the fashion house wardrobe.
For men, the suit is dominated by vest and plastron, but it can be worn in either cream or brown.
The decision on the restaurant was important.
Schmuck-less rooms in the next room aren't ideal; the ambience should be special.
Here, the Dometians listened carefully to their own offer in the restaurant.
Whoever wants to go by bus, Uwe Link has an offer.
Cats are popular among young people, he says.
Romance is also asked for invitations, bouquets of flowers, and even wedding pictures.
The "After-wedding party" is getting more and more popular, with special events taking place in particular locations, such as waterfalls, some days after the party, but in wedding clothes, said Elisabeth Keidel.
A lot of details about a successful wedding were presented in the Dominican Republic on Sunday.
Arrangements for flowers, rings, wedding bands, cakes and even a magician, like Marko Ripper, who can talk to guests stiltedly.
Don't forget proper cooking and nail care.
It's all for an unmissable party.
Google, Samsung and Huawei bailed on Nortel tablets.
The group, the infamous former Nortel patentee, enforced a law against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that was sued by Nortel for bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel laptop for 4,5 billion US dollars, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations in the United States.
Rockstar is in the Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony Group.
Google will prosecute a patent violation in seven cases.
Patents protect technology that makes searches on the internet relevant to relevant advertisements, causing the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar weren't immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make smartphones that work with Google's operating system Android, which is in fierce competition with the likes of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google gave a first-rate gift of over 900 million dollars to the Nortel Corporation.
Google increased its offer and last year offered 4,4 billion US dollars.
After it was banned by the US government for the use of Nortel chips, Google offered Motorola Mobility 12,5 billion US dollars, a business which, in turn, funded part of Motorola's library.
Even though Google tried to acquire the patent for the invention, Google has injured the patents and continues to do so," says the inscription.
Rockstar is demanding a high damages claim from Google, saying that Google's patent violation was intentional, thus the apology.
The parking fees in Frankfurt should be strong.
Parks in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city's magistrates present a presentation to the town's transport minister, Stefan Majer (green).
The parking fees will be increased by 50 percent next year.
But that doesn't mean prices should go up, but the time limit for parking and parking meters will be cut from 30 to 20 minutes.
The town council will have to decide in December.
The IHK Frankfurt says that it's not a good idea.
The parking available just opposite the shop is "not to be underestimated by smaller shops."
The transport club in Germany thinks that an increase in productivity after two decades is "overdue and, actually, overdue".
The public transport will get more expensive, too.
The price goes up to 96 USD a barrel.
The price of the oil continued to fall on Friday, worried about a high supply of a report suggesting that the production of electricity-hungry factories in China is growing.
The referezroh oil for deliveries in December was in the late morning in Europe in the electronic hands at the New York Mercantile Exchange for 14 cents on 96,24 USD.
The contract expired at 39 cents on Thursday, meaning a price hike of 8,8 percent in October.
The price of oil has gone up a lot in the past few weeks.
The energy ministry of the United States said on Wednesday that the US market had increased by 4,000 barrel last week.
In the course of five weeks, the price of 25 million barrels rose.
But on Friday, there were indications of a stronger demand for goods from two reports about an activity surge in China.
This reflects a sustained recovery in China's economy, which saw growth of 7,8 percent in the third quarter, after it had been on the lowest level since two decades ago.
Brent crude oil, a reference price for international crude oil used in US refineries, was traded at the Exchange of London for 26 cents on 108,58 USD.
The way-finding society doesn't think of it.
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but eventually it goes home.
Only: In the cabins of the passengers on the way back and forth, the smell of hunger is noticeable.
Sure, you'd better be responsible for a cocktail or a sec.
What's the closest thing to going to the nearest drive-in to buy a small change?
I'd like to be with you if it's late at night or early in the morning.
A few pips, a coke, a sandwich and then go home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry discos are noticeable.
Why doesn't it seem necessary to always dispose of fast food containers from the car window?
At the weekend, there are wafer-wrapped paper towels littering the streets and parking lots.
What's wrong? I wonder.
Are the people too lazy to take care of the dishes at home until the next meal?
It's not only that the papercraft are disappearing from the landscape.
Buses have already been covering such areas as lanes and causing accidents.
Whilst the expression "Women's company" is not exactly accurate, she probably doesn't know at all what that word actually means.
When you go on a trip in the evening, and not just with a few people in the car, you can see how a bank can look after a party of fireworks: flags, bottles and other rubbish piles are gathering there.
There would be a few more or less pots of tea, but not in opposition to the road where no one wants to rub on the other side of the table.
I already see the day when the streets in cities and towns are getting crowded, and the fast food joints need to be extended for their thirsty peasants.
Milk and egg substitutes in the spotlight.
Vegan food requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and milk.
Peeled tofu with seeds is a potent antioxidant.
Further, the vegetarian group is called the World Vegetarian Day on November 1st.
The Vegan Federation of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives on the occasion of World Vegetarian Day on November 1st.
Reined vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, substituting it for soy yogurt.
Statues of milk can be used to make use of either sugar, hazel, or rice milk.
Plants that grew on top of the world were used to produce potholes.
There are plant-based alternatives to eggs, too.
Half a dozen, for example, raw bananas can be incorporated into a cake by substituting an egg as a binder.
Either 50 grams of apple juice or a teaspoon of lemon juice and three drops of water make it suitable.
Lockers can make cakes without eggs, for example, by mixing a teabag with a spoonful of filling, an esl and three cups of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soja or semolina can meet this purpose.
According to the Vegetarian Society, around 800 000 people are vegan in Germany, as well as organically.
Is there a black box in the car?
US road planners are looking for a solution to repair the broken highway system, and believe that they've found the solution in a small black box which houses every car park in Armageddon.
The devices marking each kilometer traveled and the information relayed to the authorities are central to a complex effort by Washington and the federal planning office to implement the proposed system of financing US highways.
The normally boring area of road planning suddenly turned into an intense debate with lots of flowers.
Libertarians have spoken to environmental groups and say that the government uses the small boxes to record the distance between the kilometres traveled and, possibly, where they were driven, and then use the information for the calculation of taxes.
The tea party is over.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and has a series of privacy concerns.
But while you can't agree on a resolution in the convention, several states can't wait any longer.
They are currently looking at how they can switch to a system in the next ten years where the driver pays for the miles traveled.
A lot of drivers have already tested the navigation systems on some of them fitted with GPS.
That's really a must for our country.
There's nothing we can possibly use, said Hasan Ikhrata, president of the Southern California Association of Governments, who will display the miles traveled on all californians in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxpayer, is empty, and the US-Amerikaners set fire to the gas station.
But in America, there's not as much money as it used to be.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state's mineral tax of 18,4 cents a liter hasn't increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't want high prices for petrol, but they also don't want to raise the price of petrol by a cent.
The gas tax is simply not affordable, says Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic law at the University of Minnesota.
The US has recently confiscated 500 cars with speedometers, which should be inspected using a speedometer.
That's the most sustainable alternative, he said.
Officekrats describe it as a modest user fee.
It's no surprise that the idea of a liberal city exists, because the tax might have been put in place to influence driving behaviour so that traffic and emissions are reduced.
The cold-weather planners are setting the system for the implementation of strategies with the aim of reaching the ambitious, legally binding goals of the United States to change the climate.
But the republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also declared that he sees the most affordable long-term alternative.
Even the free marketers at Reason Foundation are motivated by the idea of having drivers pay for a return trip.
This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole, says Adrian Moore, vice president for policy.
The people pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who asked the Congress to propose a minimum bill.
US-Senate approved a 90 million dollar pilot project that would have included 10.000 cars.
But the majority in the representative house prevented the rise of the protest and responded accordingly to the concerns of Abgeordnetes from rural areas, people represented who often have to cross a lot of roads on their way to work or back home.
Many states and cities don't have any laws in place to prevent this.
The most engaged is Oregon, which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the gas tax instead of the petrol tax in the state.
Nevada has already finished a pilot project.
New York City also has such a thing.
Illinois tests for licensure.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 states in the eastern hemisphere (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently looking at how to implement the change.
The concept isn't universally acclaimed.
In Nevada, where there were only a few hundred volunteers to provide the equipment, car drivers were skeptical at the thought that the government could follow their movements.
Think about Big Brother and such things were a big problem, says Alauddin Khan, manager of strategy and performance at the Transportation Department of Nevada.
The people didn't want it.
During the test, the ACLU of Nevada posted on their website: "It would be relatively easy to convert the speedometers into inclement devices."
It's no use building a gigantic, expensive infrastructure that would be inefficiently used to collect data about individual people's daily movements.
Nevada is one of a series of states that are now considering the use of technology to catch up on the miles traveled, but not exactly when and where.
If Khan were like that, the public would be calmer.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup called True Mile in California.
The company was not originally formed to help state governments with the taxation of cars.
It was much more important for her goal to cover the market for kfz-insurance on foot in an ever-growing market, paying for the drivers on the basis of the miles traveled.
But the devices you've tested are interesting for the road planners because they don't work with GPS and only provide limited information, which are updated daily.
People are more willing to participate if their speed and location aren't marked down," said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have been made big mistakes.
There are a lot of cheaper and less intrusive ways to do that.
In Oregon, the planners are trying to give car drivers a choice of options.
You can choose whether you want a GPS receiver or not.
Either they don't pick a device and pay a flat fee instead based on the average of all the people in the state who drive a bike.
Others hope to sell the concept of a fake audience by selling devices with more functions than less.
Traffic cameras in New York City are being developed to allow drivers to pay for parking fees, so they'll have to pay only for kilometres traveled, and speed data from other vehicles will be collected real-time thanks to the driver's traffic lights.
Auto drivers would be encouraged to participate by the value of the system, according to a plan document.
Some commuters wonder whether the whole rumour about the pay per mile is a huge distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay told officials that the Congress can solve the problem of the lack of a reliable highway fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or a year's allowance could help drivers of hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol, so they can pay a fair share.
There's no reason for an operation when an aspirin is rich, explains Randy Rentschler, the commissioner for legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of car drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Bad-Durch: A dream will come true for the FC.
The significance of the city and the football club were celebrated at the official opening ceremony for the art gallery in spite of the cold weather and the rain.
Everyone had expected a more pleasant party on Saturday last weekend, but Petrus didn't want to take part in it.
That's how many people who came without umbrellas or couldn't hold a candle for any reason.
That went to the musicians who were arranging the fest, just as many people would say.
Nass was the reason the FC president-elect Albrecht Schlenker spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks go to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who has been actively engaged in the implementation of the project, the council, the involved companies and associations that have joined him.
There's something very Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Henri Gail and Peter Graf.
The humble renters made 400 cubic metres of bricks for the new paths.
This lauded voluntary engagement paid tribute to the chairman of the local council, Karl Rombach.
The city's vice-president of the soccer association Kuno Kayan, and the head of the planning department, who announced a spending for the youth section of the club.
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that the original plot of war was so crowded in spring and autumn that it couldn't be played out.
Before 15 years ago, the first solutions to the problem were being considered when building a third place on the pitch of the football club or at the real school in Salisbury.
Both were again smashed.
In the past six years, plans for an art gallery were being considered as the ultimate solution.
In two years, when the FC took over the Schabeltube in Erbpacht, a cost of 100 000 euros for the building of the stadium and the land grant of 104 000 euros were allocated to the country.
The council decided in October 2012 to take the remaining 356 000 euros, together with the total cost of 560 000 euro.
The construction of the 68-meter high art gallery began on June 4th.
During the course of the construction phase over three months, 3000 kilograms of earth were taken from the site used for the design of a dirt bike.
Unknown girls were kidnapped by a car.
Unknown people injured a 12-year-old in Sachsen-Anhalt when they struck a car.
The terrorists in Genthen on Thursday evening probably fired at a group of children with an air force weapon.
That gave the police a break.
The girl was easily injured in the leg.
The girl was taken to hospital by ambulance.
The shoe came from a small car which had run into a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The terrorists shot at a bus stop, too.
A splintered fragment.
Then they drove off.
The policemen will investigate on Friday.
Snowden prepared to cooperate with Germany on US-U.S. surveillance.
Edward Snowden, the head of the US intelligence service, said he was willing to travel to Berlin and ask for an interview before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and her director Keith Alexander didn't answer their questions about their activities.
The German parliamentarian Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Donnerstag to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he writes: "While the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government still treats it as a rebellion and seeks to criticise political opinion with impunity."
To tell the truth is not to be a crime.
In the letter to Snowden, he is convinced that the international community can convince the American government to drop the criticism against him.
The allegations made by the US Justice Ministry include spying and bribery.
Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, we'll find ways to do that."
The relations between the US and Germany are strained by claims that the NSA intercepted Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the head of the committee responsible for the secret service, said that he'd take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if it were possible to "without harming him and ruining relations with the US at all".
Strewth, a Gründer, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists while he was in Russia.
Stroubel said that according to the lawyer for the former NSA agents, Snowden can't go back to Russia if he leaves the country.
When snow falls in Germany, it is necessary for him to make sure that he's "safe" there, as the order says.
Snowden explained in his letter that he saw a "solid and fortified" coup against those he ran from his home.
He was however disturbed by the global reaction to "my act of political opinion".
In the whole world, high-ranking politicians – even in the United States – have declared the rise of an unconstitutional system a service to the general public.
In his letter Snowden offers the German authorities a cooperation "whereby the difficulties related to human rights were solved".
Strictly speaking, concerns about the security of Mosambique are growing in light of the clashes between powerful personalities.
Taus of people gather in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eye of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to sign the peace declaration in a rare public demonstration.
We want peace again, we want stability, said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
In fear of the future of the country, they exchanged their business clothes for a T-shirt with the slogan "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd at the Central Market on Thursday.
Every day for two weeks there are reports of tensions between the government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst things that have happened since the end of the peace process more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially led by whites to rule Rhodesia and later the Apartheid movement in South Africa to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the peace agreement of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it's unlikely that the country will fall into a conflict overgrown, but recent events from foreign investors and local authorities have worried many.
The rapid growth of the economy is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas reserves in the north-west and the development of coal mines could bring in the next few years investment of more than 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Val de Brasilia, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA.
The governing Flimo-Partei, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo are both to blame for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government sanctioned the latest meeting when it attacked its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional highburg.
The raids on the former rebels were escalating when government troops attacked the Renamo regime and tried to kill Afonso Dhakama, the leader of the group, declaring that the Red Crescent was in front of the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the coup and accuses the organisation of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to talk about an instability.
In response to AFP, the French news agency said on Wednesday that Dhlakama claimed to be a loser because "all his remaining forces join to prove he can influence the government's decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo said they want to avoid a war.
But since Mazanga was zittered, Renamo signed the peace treaty of 1992.
In response to the FT, he said that he thought that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
Our vision is to engage in negotiations again and, yes, seriously," said Mazanga.
Early talks between the parties did little to address the tensions that were fuelled by a series of summits this year.
We've got two mature men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who mix the pots, says Joseph Hanlon, a professor at the Open University and a molecular expert.
No one of them is good at negotiations and no one is willing to do the necessary concessions.
Renamo, the party that controls elections, has already announced that they'll boycott the election in November.
Elections for president and parliament are planned for next year.
Several commentators have used violence as the attempt to control a vicious movement to stop protests and financial benefits from the government.
Election results in 1992, while a new party, founded by an ex-Ramo member, will probably improve the election results.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose second term expires next year – will destroy the democracies of the country if it fails to do so.
He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up his presidency", said Mazanga.
It's unclear what the capacity of the Renamo holds, but she has regularly carried out vicious attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south corridor.
The majority of the fish were found in the province of So Paulo, a few hundred kilometres from Méditerra, on the other side of which lies the port of Rio Tinto and Val, used for exporting coals.
In June, Rio ceased the use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga answered back with a question whether Renamo will renew this drought.
Renamo said the international community warned that things weren't well in Mozambique, adding Mazanga.
The instability has intensified the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, saying that many people are already worried about corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent upsurge in corruption.
The people think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and the judiciary should be responsible for solving the problems, he says.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted stability.
Renamo and Frelimo are interested because they just want to have peace and useable streets back, he said.
Hansjakob goes to the Freihof again.
Heinrich Hansjakob put his ageing in Hulsach, and on Sunday, his last two years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were delighted by the extremely short scene.
From the announcement of the establishment of the Ehrenbürgerschaft to his death, director-turned-director Alois Kraftzcyk produced an understated piece that received a lot of criticism from the Cornelia people.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explaining the similarities and the breakdown of time from youth to retirement.
Hansjakob is home on October 22nd 1913 in his children's room.
And then the scene began, when Alois Krafczyk once again appeared in his parade as a great son of the city.
Stiletto took the form of two-spanners and "warm feeders" from Erich Becher from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he applauded by the audience, but his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Herman was incredibly good at portraying himself in the role of the sister and transforming her untimely life into something extraordinary.
In between the various games, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played carefully selected music and rounded off the performance.
In honour of the Ehrenbürgerwürde, the then-Mayor of Haifa, Heinz Winkler, in tribute to the preservation of the ancient fort, together with a part of the city council, made a war.
After their war, the three singers invited the Hansjakob to the meeting: "How nice that there will be youth rebellions in my own three years."
With her song "O Jesuit", she delighted the audience in the courtyard as well as the orphans of St. Patrick's Day with their singing "Here, out!"
Hansjakob's criticism of the church at that time was as important as his thinking about the future of agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war.
In the homestead, behind his cape on the brim, he found his refuge.
A wicked spirit had finally found peace and was gone for ever home, he said at the end of the scene.
A lot of applause and a lot of praise were given by the audience for the performance.
The Chinese newspaper is to be called "reform" after a call.
A Chinese newspaper which had demanded the release of a reporter for discrimination was supposed to be reformated, said a press secretary.
The Shanghai-based newspaper New Express had a rare public appeal to the expulsion of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But later on telly, Chen admitted that he'd paid a fine to report a theft of a part-state company.
Now the New Express will undergo a comprehensive review, said the regulator.
The "Responsibility Act" was passed by the Ministry of Press, Publications, Radio, Film and TV in Guangdong.
Recent reports revealed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangting Evening News Group, published several unrelated reports on the controversial company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
The redacting of the new express was disordered, the regulator said in a statement.
She said that she's decided to hang Chen Yongzhou's administrative punishment and remove his report card from him.
In addition, the Yangon Evening News Group recommended a complete review of the new express and advised it to the relevant authorities to investigate the new express and immediately the leadership team to check it.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on ongoing financial irregularities at a manufacturer of building machinery whose name was Zoomlion.
After he had been arrested, the newspaper published two appeals for his release on the front page, and put back his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on television and admitted that he had written false reports against payment.
In this case, I damaged the flashpoint as well as the entire news industry and their efforts to win public trust," he said in front of the state's television station.
I did it first because I was out of money.
It became clear to me that I was wrong.
In response to Chen's apology, the New Express posted an apology on the front page, explaining that it had been missed checking the reports correctly.
Several suspects have been arrested in recent times on television.
Experts say sentences are still being imposed routinely, even though a law changed at the beginning of the year prohibiting the prosecution of anyone for lying to themselves.
Löwen: There's still one candidate for mayor, but there's only one.
Even though the Bay of Pigs with its 7514 inhabitants, a modern infrastructure, a forward-thinking school, youth and senior policy, as well as the city's reputation as an attractive town, hasn't yet registered a second mayor candidate.
As the only candidate for the election to replace the incumbent mayor Norbert Brügger, a 46-year banker and manager, is out of his mind when he picks up The Köpfler from Löwen.
The deadline for applications is Monday, November 11th at 18 o'clock.
Haigerloch: The Mt. Rushmore is back in the spotlight.
As part of the city's 150-year celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the cultural and tourism office of the town held its last public meeting on the 27th of October, the evening mass.
After the visit of the Atomic Weapons Museum, Haigerloch will be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under pre-US rule.
The most important final point is a visit to the church of St. John's.
There, the lead singers tell the story of the building of the church and gain an insight into the development of the evangelical community through and through catholicism.
Not to the least, in the church is the view of Friedrich Schüz who with the help of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter created a fairy tale.
It's an original reproduction of the famous Mailänder paintings by Leonardo da Vinci.
The atomic bomb's deadliest place in the world is at 15 o'clock.
There are tickets at the atomic bomb museum.
For questions and information, the tourism office of Haigerloch is available.
Mick Jagger says he's never met Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
In an interview with a foreign radio presenter this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits The Hard" from 2004.
Perry said she had eaten dinner with the alt-rocker and that he "was eating it when I was 18".
She added: "This has been a long time, and he's been very kind to me."
In a statement made by a representative of Jaggers, 70, on Thursday, he said that he thinks that he's ever had an affair with Katy Perry.
The representative said that she might have been mistaken for someone else.
Perry was one of the singers who had an appearance on the Rolling Stones this year.
Her new album "Prism" was on Anhieb's top 10 this week.
The NSA says that it's a "internal mistake" and not a hacker who crashed the website.
The sworn national security agency said that a bug had been lurking on her public website for several hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
SECRETARY.gov was out of reach for several hours today because there was an intern error while updating a planned update, the agency explained in an email.
The problem will arise this evening.
The claim that the incident was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) wasn't true.
In the early evenings, online servers reported that the NSA website wasn't accessible for at least six hours and some users weren't getting it.
A spokesperson for the NSA told ABC News that the sensible internal network of the antennas was "in no way" compatible.
Secret information isn't in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have hacked the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
During such attacks, the target website will be overloaded with page redirects until the server is down and the website is broken.
Cyberspace is relatively small, and attacks don't serve to infiltrate the internal network of the target system.
The former superstitious NSA, nicknamed "No such agency" in recent months, faces intense criticism from the public and looks at the recent spate of revelations about her ambitious surveillance programme in the United States and abroad – a result of the hacking of former NSA agents Edward Snowden and the release of it.
The growing conspiracy against the intelligence service sparked widespread speculation that today's result is a targeted cyperoperation.
Snow in Russia could happen, too.
Edward Snowden, an ex-US intelligence officer, could also make statements in the US spying on people in Russia.
Deputy ministers of state could ask either written questions or 30-year-olds to meet in person in Russia.
This brought the agent's office of interfax under investigation for not being able to reach more familiar circles.
A question like this can be resolved between states, if only.
Snowbirds from Russia are practically out of the question.
In this case, he loses his status as a refugee, the agent said.
Since Germany was the United States, when there were snowfalls on the way, it continued to rain.
Children should learn myths and legends as "models of life", says an author.
The stories of Thor show that brute strength has no chance against clever tricks, and the Artus legend shows how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths were too far gone to be too stingy and, in some cases, too dirty to be used to teach children how to live. That's why Crossley-Holland praised a "fair choice" of old-fashioned works.
I think it's wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I've been planning on doing that for twenty years.
He added that when authors and teachers who are "overly dodgy" would turn children down, because in understood stories the messages would be "understood".
Crossley-Holland, translated from the Anglo-Saxon, and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You can follow certain intentions, but you should keep them in mind."
The biggest difference between a mature author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the fact that they are trying to convey hope.
Not everything has to be reconciled or to a happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This has to be explained in a subtle way, so that the story can be revealed and not explained.
It's an old story told from the inside out.
Did you think that travel agencies existed thanks to the internet?
Flight Centre seems to be changing the trend.
The company has increased its profit margins for the year and expects a rise in holiday spending in Australia and Britain.
The travel company is now operating on a net income of between 350 and 350 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollar in its earlier plan.
If the current targets are met, it means a growth of between 12 and 17 percent compared to the return on investment of 290,4 million dollar in 2011/12.
According to managing director Graham Turner, Flight Centre achieved a profit of eight percent first half and enjoyed a strong start in the second half, particularly in the Australian and British private businesses.
At the end of the year, our ten countries are profitable, and some of them are on good terms with respect to the outlook for the year ahead in terms of inflation and taxes," he said.
Those are Australia and Britain, typical of our harshest results.
In Australia, the leisure industry grew in the second half of the year, creating a relatively weak market for business travellers.
The same goes for the leisure business at the British Airways, while the business people are less expensive here.
The US economy recovered against the seasonal weakening of the first half, so that a profit is expected for the whole year for the third year in succession.
The shares of the flight centre rose by three cents yesterday to 38,20 dollars.
The Falkenberger discotheque makes for a great dinner.
The new season at the Falkenberger discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
The following Friday night is called "Pump this party", and the following Saturday evening, it's going to be a more than 25-person party.
Of course, the organizers promise smooth beats and cool sounds on both days.
Postage stamps are scarce on Sundays.
'Viel citizens won't be noticed, the red points for the Sunday bulletins are still scattered across the centre of town and the suburbs, but reading the circular on the post office counter quickly it becomes clear that the election isn't taking place on Sundays and holidays, says the FDP.
A request by the FDP confirmed this.
Sons and holidays are only going to be left before the Post Office on Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and in the Jakob-Müller Street 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether it's raining or not in the garden, the FDP won't respond to the question.
The socialist and justice-minded speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to anchor here.
The Sunday leave is at the post office, an important service.
This subcontractor is unlikely to accept this offer in spite of the price hike for letters in January 2013 being radical and immutable."
Tom Bittner, vice-president of the Liberals, supports his group's resolution: "What I dislike is the fact that there are secret shifts in the voting times or cuts here."
The post office is a mile away from here.
By the end of the day, the postboxes in the town should be emptied up in order to give the town's residents some fresh air.
Even in the heart of the city, especially not mobile Mitbürgers need to post a letter box with Sunday delivery.
Rutherbeck asked in the town hall whether the city council discussed this matter with the post office.
Mayor Erich Maier responded that the post office didn't cooperate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge gives rise to a Sunday sale in Hofheim, too.
Her party has spoken out against privatisation.
Decisions will be made in another direction, said Maier.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other.
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr plan to separate their ways in future.
Bloom admitted that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two year-olds.
Actress Orlando Bloom praised his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, the Friday (Orts time) should be broadcasted, said Bloom, sometimes life doesn't go exactly as we expect it to.
Kerr and he himself still love each other, said the 36-year-old.
We'll support each other and love being parents of flying birds.
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010; in 2011 her son was born.
Haslach: Skepsis appears to be a serious problem.
With the election of the parish council for 2015, the basic beliefs of the congregation will change, among other things.
There is then only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the governors of Haifa, Hofstet, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Stein and Welshstein discussed the changes.
There's nothing to change about the basic provisions of the divorce, and it's up to the parishioners to make this as satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day, the skeleton against the new looked sharper, but clearly visible.
From the preparations for the new year 2015 to the concrete proposals for the future of the parish council and the size of the parish council, the six Gremies held their most constructive talks with the head of the parish council.
Regionaldelegate Georg Schmitt presented a presentation of the newly adopted directives on medical emergencies in the European Union.
Danach forms the Slovak church as a future body of the public law, which includes the rights and obligations of six individual church congregations.
There's only going to be a council of parishes and a council of trustees in which the pastor-general is represented.
Every parish should have at least two elected members, and each of the six parishes are formed into a so-called community team.
Her task will be to promote the peaceful life in the town in future.
When it came to the finances of the individual parishes, there was a lot of talk-in-progress.
The news is that donations made to the parishes will stay.
The bounds are against the whole community.
Just in view of the big investment plans, which all parishes are obliged to undertake, there was a lot of thought.
In the past, only projects were put in projects that could be financed by the individual pastors of the parishes, according to Haslach's pastor-general Bruno Prinzbach.
Pragmatic experience with a community church for five parishes illustrated Baroque Ritters, the chairperson of the Gremium in the St. Andrew's Episcopal Church.
They'd been asked in 2006 to stay "one by five" and had to prove it wasn't that easy.
The committee on pastoral care made up their mind to consider the future composition and size of the parish councils, as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The work will be put into practice in further sessions and in a further meeting of the six Gremies set to be held in the coming spring.
At the end, pastor Michael Schöner presented from Stein the new logo of the church which was adopted by a clear majority.
Taxes for foreign investors in real estate against London's inflation rate.
The finance ministry has put an end to the cap on the CGT, but still awaits the final decision of the cabinet secretary George Osborne, who voted in favour of a tax increase of 7% on flats in the budget 2012, which would cost over two million pounds and annual fees for buyers, keeping apartments as a company and not as individuals.
From now on, the incomes from the Stamp Act for the City of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea stood at 708 million pounds in fiscal year 2012/13, the surpluses for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North, North and West, Yorkshire and the region Humber.
Cook said: "On the other hand, the taxation of high-priced apartments and the introduction of the law relating to this legislation can easily be claimed to have made it clear that expensive properties are taxed too low, taking into account the effects of the veracity tax system."
Should some foreign investors stop buying real estate in London or the owners stop selling it, he added.
The most expensive properties on the market in London's south-west, which stretch from Fulham to Wimbledon, have declined by 8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed an average annual growth of 5,6 %, but on the other side of the city, the north (7,4 %) and the east (6,5 %) experienced a downward trend, according to a survey by Savills.
Even though the SG Achim/Baden haven't won in four games, the handball players still enjoy a good atmosphere.
That doesn't make any doubt to Tomasz Malmon.
Everyone is still fully motivated by the matter.
Dennoch, I hope we finally win again.
Even though I don't know yet how to taste a victory, Malmon expects a success story from his team in the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the drittliga reserve from Fredericton hasn't cut down any trees yet, monsoon warns the Zeefinger in advance.
Many players I've already trained for the A-Jugend.
They'll certainly be very much motivated by their ex-coach.
It is necessary to wait to see if there'll be any progress from the first time, said the coach.
To finally make it back to the success story, the Malmon team must definitely stand out from the previous contenders.
All things considered in the preparation for and during the game of strategy came to an end abruptly.
Even the chance of winning has to be improved in the end.
I hope that my players finally get their heads off during the short break.
USA want to follow Snowden further strafily.
The United States hasn't changed its attitude towards former U.S. soldiers Edward Snowden.
He'll continue to be urged to disclose secret information.
Since he needs to face a criminal prosecution in the USA, said the spokesperson for the US-Audits in Washington.
Even the latest occurrences of snow would not change anything.
In response to a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Grünen-Politiker Hans-Christian Ströbele asked the United States not to punish him any longer for crimes.
Psaki said that street protests are mainly directed at the hand of a parliamentarian and not against the German government.
Report: Obama campaign decided to replace Hillary Clinton with Hillary Clinton.
The most senior advisers of President Barack Obama have secretly planned to replace Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the election campaign, reports The New York Times.
The verdict is the most significant surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilman on the election campaign 2012, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is showing an example of the first-ever forthcoming book, and on Thursday night, the top adviser for the presidents said they had carried out extensive group meetings and referendums to find out whether Obama's slim hope of regaining office would be better off if he let down Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent at the Times, the book chronicles the struggle between the campaign workers and the white house, focusing on the former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it had on the candidates for president Clinton to swap with the vice president.
The potentiary change was a strictly secret within the campaign finance structure in Chicago and in the oval office.
Only a half-dozen of the president's top advisers – including Daley, former campaign manager Obama, Jim Messina, and the former White House chiefs David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
In "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley had risen to the top of the ranks in spite of her "enjoying, personal relationships", but ultimately decided against a candidate Clinton's "the chance of improving significantly" would be diminished.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually decided to replace Clinton by Clinton.
I mentioned a whole host of things you should take into consideration, and that was one of them," said Daley in the magazine.
Remembering the president's furious questions at the time, we asked God: "Does God want us to do?"
While Daley called the investigations "off-the-shelf," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for the election there was a lot of work being done to find out whether or not a similar train would be present in the near future of the elections.
Campaigns won't allocate as much money to questions and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something, said Martin on AC360.
However, it's not clear if Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his damascus knew about the potential change.
Even though Daley said he didn't think the president of the possible change knew, the former cabinet secretary admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "double down" didn't provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political divisions on Obama's desk had reached its goal.
Cooper asked Martin whether he thought that Obama didn't know anything about the election results.
"Mom", answered Martin.
The council is happy about a solid budget.
Every time there's a council meeting about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The village council in Herdwange is well stocked, and the administration hasn't been active since 2005.
Even the budget year 2012 can be described as a full success in this respect.
This was clearly seen in the year-end statement for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the budget for the administration was about 7,6 million euros higher than planned.
Even the budget surplus of the administration stood at about 1.8 million euros, roughly one million euros over the budget.
To be appreciated are the excise taxes and the local income tax.
Even the balance of assets showed a clear decline over the expected value.
According to the planned 1,5 million euros, he saved 2.5 million euros last year.
That's largely due to the higher allocation of funds from the budget, says Roth.
Since there were less investments in the budget year 2012 than originally planned, the refunds have also been higher.
Overall, the total return could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to about 4.9 million euros now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
A work isn't easy to do without a little elbow grease, said Gerster with a glance at the yearbook.
He and the councillors were evidently happy about the good numbers.
It may sound strange, but just these good numbers could soon cost the people dearly.
Because of the good finances, the community was able to avoid high taxes in the past.
That's why some people say they've been getting sicker and sicker all the time.
There are conditions for these Zuspeisen from diverse outgoings.
Under and above, cities and towns that bean certain kinds of meat must prove certain principles.
We've got to look at the subject of marriage equality, as in the coming years there are investments that we would like to invest in, said Gers.
Lions: More than 100 young catacombs from the small Himalaya reinforced their belief in the firmation.
In two church services, 101 15 and 16-year-olds from the local youth service were confirmed to be homeless at the small town of Heuberg.
The service of the Lord was led by the group Laudato Si, followed by the youth choir The Spirit in the afternoon.
With the lifting of the firmament, the youths said yes to their duties and praised the power of the holy will.
The firmlings had been working in the past months under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of a number of community members for the big party.
Through various projects, they learned about different aspects of church life and shared the youth day in the basement.
Screaming desperation from an Obama campaigner.
I elected President Obama two times in hopes of making change possible.
He says that Obama has praised the efforts made by the Republikaner to block its blockade.
The blockade didn't excuse the website problem of Obamacare, the asthma attack.
Obama's memories of the 2008 election were a sad reminder of what might have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a medical student at Harvard for the second year.
I'm currently reading a heartbreaking book.
It's a book I thought would inspire me to finish my medical studies in the dark second year and give me hope again.
It's called "The courage to win" and depicts Barack Obama's presidential election campaign.
When I finish my patients' diary and go to bed, the book will take me back in a time when the politics of the world changed and a speech could be made.
Alegers were defeated by an earthquake, and broadcasters halted the election to bring the historical significance of this hour into focus.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was heading towards the white house, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his approval rating was 82 %.
And then I close the book.
Resetting the clocks on the other side is a bad awakening, as if you're about to die of a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem like avage memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I gave up my voice, something has really changed.
But it's just not what I could have imagined.
I know the great and varied things that Obama has achieved from the signing of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the ongoing sexual relations between the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I'm also of the opinion that the political blockade against our country has caused too many protests against what should be done to our country: reforms, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, just to name a few.
Despite having defended the Obama administration on numerous occasions, I came to an agreement with my explanations attempts at the end.
I reached a point of political despair.
The republican blockade cannot explain why the arrest of foreign nationals for crimes against humanity or the death of innocent children by murder.
It can't be explained why the National Security Agency gathers data on the private life of Americans and why whistleblowers are being ordered to investigate the state's misconduct.
It can't be explained why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was executed without trial, and yet why the limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential election were raised during the election.
The results of a report, in which it is said that the efforts of white houses to suppress the media have been the "most aggressive... since Nixon's administration".
And the latest isn't the incapacity to admit that there's been a simple website for more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was abolished.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.
I should've understood that the government's work on her ongoing political campaign could make a difference.
Offensively, the committee doesn't have a pre-emptive course, since an opposition party and unexpected events such as the Newtown Massacre dominate the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem far from being elected by the government.
And that's what bothers me most.
I elected Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidate.
Romney presented a confusing and unpopular alternative, not being able to articulate his direction and positions.
I had the feeling that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would give hope to those we'd heard so long ago.
But with the drop in the voter turnout for Obama by 45 % this week, the book's cover turned so ugly in 2008 as well.
I hear the sound of the many promises that have been made in the air.
This week, I read an excerpt in the book that describes how Obama had to make a heavy defeat against Clinton in the presidential election in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the television station after the election, he told his employees that they needed to go back on course and see the purpose of their matter.
I'd like to find our magic back, he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I could not agree more strongly with you.

Strewth: Damage to the skull after an accident.
The scene of the accident was reported when a 51-year-old driver on Ibiza's motorway went out of town on Thursday night, at 20.
Shortly before the junction of the motorway, he noticed that he was heading towards Stromeyersdorf road and switched to the right.
Here came to a head-to-head meeting with the there-running BMW, a 23-year-old dancer.
Perhaps a 19-year-old was driving a VW Passat behind the wheel.
In total, about 15 000 people were killed by the police.
The tram had to be stopped during the accident investigation, so it continued.
In Pfullendorf, the electricity is more expensive.
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to put up with higher electricity bills.
According to the manager of the town hall, Jörg-Arne Bias, a four-person Pfullendorf family spends between 70 and 90 euros a year on accommodation.
The main reason for the price hike is the increase in the so-called EEGs from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilogram.
Each year in October, the four operators of the large electricity grids introduce this new regulation.
These offset the cost of energy bills that they can lower through a hike in the price of electricity.
The town halls are the last remaining in this box.
The chairman of the energy company was forecasting a higher demand, as Jörg Arne Bias reported.
Now the precise price needs to be calculated before the city councils can inform their customers about the exact price next week.
We're going on an inheritance of one cent and a half, according to Bias, whereby the number will be close to two cents.
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years about his childhood and youth from the lake.
The katastrophes of his poor village life - the lack of language, the hang over violence and sexuality, the Eng and Fearlessness - have been described many times by the writer poets.
Known as a prodigy, the theatre text is rare in his work.
Gerhard Fresacher's performance of "Wetterlights on the tip of the pole", now visible in the garage X on the Petersplatz, is therefore a collage of prosa texts.
The actor combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibo" (1987) with prose from "Lebanon, his family still alive" (2003).
Surrounding the vastly dispersed stage - important requisition: a broken sofa, which is being used to copy and masturbates - hangs the eight-strong ensemble through the text material.
It seems to me that Regisseurs are reluctant to trust the text.
The 70-minüt performance is abridged in a fillet to Regime episodes known from the Repertory post-drama.
All of a sudden, actresses come to mind when it comes to the subtext of rather questionable scenes.
They'll be hard-hit, sinking their heads under water, and stagging their evenings on the wall.
Eating in cellulite or mice, staving themselves to dangerously high strewths by the instigation, either monologizing loudly on the stage or lying completely hidden on the stage.
The text does not convey itself in this threatening way, however.
The best moment of the evening is when the music is played - the band width ranges from deep purple to the voluptuous lullaby.
At the end of the show there's a quiet moment, and whispers of absurd humor burst out.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Riesen grows.
The chances of staying in the league for the sport-abhorse Ludwigsburg B.B.
Since it's supposed to be a wild card game, then there's going to be less poisoning for the neck rodents now.
Hamburg Towers is considering a possible replacement for the basketball team.
We won't take part in the Wild Card race, said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been working on a concept for a professional club in the Hansestadt since 2012.
Even though a first revolt was not to be tolerated in Ludwigsburg, it did not.
We're not busy with the Wild Card negotiations for so long that we don't know that Düsseldorf won't get a license", said Alexander Reil, head of the Neckar-Rose newspaper.
Düsseldorf Baskets can still win matches at the Schiedsgericht until 23. Mai and prove their economic ability in the Bundesliga.
However, the Germans won the license two times before.
The court of justice is the last sentence.
