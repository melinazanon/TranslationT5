"Do you want to rebuild the track ""At Shattered"" in order to make way for more safe travel?"	"Soll der Bahnübergang ""Am Hirschen"" aufwändig umgebaut werden, um die Verkehrssicherheit zu erhöhen?"
1246	Yes, the councillors have shut.	Yes, the mayors have approved.	Yes, the councillors have decided.	Ja, haben die Gemeinderäte beschlossen.
1247	If you want to take care of yourself, please put in €200,000.	If you want to take a slice of that, you have to take it by the hand.	Maybe I'll have to take a couple of euros.	Schiltach muss dafür 220 000 Euro in die Hand nehmen.
1248	The German railway plans to improve the Kinzal rail line next year.	The German railway plans to improve the Kiningbahn in the coming year.	The German railway is going to improve the Kining railway line in the coming year.	Die Deutsche Bahn will im kommenden Jahr die Kinzigtal-Bahnstrecke verbessern.
1249	Specially should the security on the railways be increased - it's common for trains to collide with other vehicles.	The speed of the railways should be increased, because regular collisions between trains and other vehicles happen across the country.	Particularly, the safety of trains should be increased: regular collisions between cars and railways occurs across the country.	Besonders soll dabei die Sicherheit an Bahnübergängen erhöht werden - regelmäßig kommt es bundesweit zu Kollisionen von Zügen mit anderen Fahrzeuge.
1250	If the council want to fund the improvements, they must contribute one third to the costs, and the rest by rail and bing.	In order to fund the reconstruction, the locals must cover the cost by a third, while the rest split the railway and the road.	When councils vote for the redevelopment, they must share their costs by a third, while the rest split their railway and trams.	Stimmen die Gemeinden den Umbaumaßnahmen zu, müssen sie sich mit einem Drittel an den Kosten beteiligen, den Rest teilen sich Bahn und Bund.
1251	"Architectural councillor Roland Grubber described the significance of the bahoon to the local communityrat ""am stags""."

"Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber erläuterte dem Gemeinderat die Besonderheiten des Bahübergangs ""Am Hirschen""."
1252	There the town is making a road network across the town in height of the tunnels to the west of the railway line.	There the city build a fort in the foot of the tunnels north of the railway line.	There the city was able to build a railway line from the elevated tunnels to the west of the station.	Dort plant die Stadt, in Höhe des dortigen Tunnelmundes westlich der Bahngleise eine Ausbuchtung zu bauen.
1253	There could be larger vehicles, for example those carrying heavy trees, being parked in the middle of traffic without having to block the roads.	There could be bigger vehicles such as those that transport heavy bodies in transit, without having to go over the top.	There could be bigger vehicles, like the Langholz transporting, in transit, without having to stop the engines.	Dort könnten auch größere Fahrzeuge, zum Beispiel solche, die Langholz transportieren, bei Gegenverkehr stehen, ohne die Gleise blockieren zu müssen.
1254	At the same time, planners decided to construct a necessary bridge so as to allow the street to cross the overflowing streets in order to ensure a relatively seamless traffic flow.	Driving officers therefore suggest the necessary scaffolding be installed to make sure that the streets connecting the road can be widened so that they can provide the city with sufficient time to ensure a relatively low traffic flow.	Brightoners therefore urged the City to adopt a necessary road system to ensure that the streets adjacent to the town can be widened when there's hardly any traffic flow to ensure a safe passage of the city.	Grießhaber schlug daher vor, eine erforderliche Stützmauer so zu konstruieren, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße zu gegebener Zeit verbreitern könne, um einen reibungslosen Verkehrsfluss zu gewährleisten.
1255	This was debated in the council, as some protests raised the issue of having a street closure in doubt. Thomas Kipp brought up the point that critics were asking why we had so few vehicles and thus much money in our hands?	"As some residents of the council debated the possibility of a traffic ban: Thomas Kipp put his argument in favour of a ban on cars being driven up by the argument that it ""must be we have to take that much money"""	While some councillors discussed the issue of pedestrian bans, Tom Kipp put the criticism of the commentator on the point that we ought to take so little money that way.	"Dies wurde im Gemeinderat kontrovers diskutiert, da einige Räte die Notwendigkeit einer Straßenverbreitung in Zweifel zogen: Thomas Kipp brachte mit seiner Äußerung die Stimmung der Kritiker auf den Punkt: ""Müssen wir wegen so wenigen Fahrzeugen so viel Geld in die Hand nehmen?"""
1256	"Mayor Thomas Haas said that the railway station ""Hirsch"" is regularly used for transporting long-length trains."	Mayor Tom Haas announced that the railway network is regularly used for long-distance transport.	Mayor Tom Haas said the railway tracks are used regularly for long-distance transport.	"Bürgermeister Thomas Haas widersprach: Der Bahnübergang ""Hirschen"" werde regelmäßig für Langholztransporte genutzt."
1257	Even wood from the zone Kuhbach will sometimes be transported across this route because the line at the Häberlebrücke isn't utilisable for the 20 metre long vehicles because they can't access the main road.	"Even wood from the section ""Kuhbach"" will be used to transport this part of this road because the bridge between the port and the main road isn't open to the public for the next 20 m, leaving it not clear of the main road."	Even lumber from the section of Kuhbach will be transported across this route because the up to 20 m long vehicles that run past the harbour couldn't use the line because they couldn't get in the main road.	"Selbst Holz aus dem Bereich ""Kuhbach"" werde teilweise über diese Strecke transportiert, weil die bis zu 20 Meter langen Fahrzeuge die Strecke an der Häberlesbrücke nicht nutzen könnten, weil sie dort nicht in die Hauptstraße abbiegen könnten."
1258	Further to the south, the track is meant to provide a link between the tunnels which are closed when the road is blocked by the main line.	Further along the track is a network of traffic lights used to stop those vehicles that can't use the tunnel if the main road is closed, argued magistrates.	To the contrary, the tracks are intended as a bypass for those vehicles that may not use the tunnel when the main road is closed, argumentative Haas.	Darüber hinaus diene die Strecke als Umleitungfür diejenigen Fahrzeuge, die den Tunnel nicht benutzen dürfen, wenn die Hauptstraße gesperrt ist, argumentierte Haas.
1259	"Having been seen that the turrets on the top and bottom of the city are being built and mended, it can be said that the lines to cross the ""Flying Hills"" can be extended to the back of the station for a longer period, as well as taking into account how they are in Wolfham the Fall currently, so they can be extended to the ""Hirs"" section of the metro."	"Scattered to the point where tunnels and bridges need to be constructed and inspected as they are now in Wolfsburg, the rail network could potentially provide for a longer period the ""Historic"" crossroads, also providing a vital access signal."	"Even though it is unlikely that tunnels between the city centre and the forks will need to be widened and mended, the railway bridge ""At the summit"" can be used for a longer period because it covers a significant section of the way."	"Da abzusehen sei, dass Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnel umgebaut und saniert werden müssten, wie dies derzeit in Wolfach der Fall ist, könne dem Bahnübergang ""Am ""Hirschen"" auch für einen längeren Zeitraum eine wichtige Verkehrsbedeutung zukommen."
1260	The reason for the raid came to be to see how much the planned enlargement of the street would cost.	The people began to consider the cost of the proposed widening of the road.	The race gathered to let the option be laid about the cost of widening the street considering the planned closure of the road.	Die Räte kamen überein, untersuchen zu lassen, welche Kosten die angedachte Verbreiterung der Straße verursachen würde.
1261	In light of the fact that the repaving of the railway tracks was more likely to involve construction of the necessary support structures so as to prevent the construction of the underground bridges needed to connect the city with the next railway track on the length of approximately 5,5 metres.	Having in mind the fact that the resurfacing of the track was eventually agreed to require the necessary scaffolds be built so that the city can take out the next line of railway tracks as far away as possible on round five metres.	"Considering that the upgrade of the rail platform was agreed upon, the necessary stiles should be constructed to make the city's new railway line an upgradable length for the eventual carriageway ""Bahnhof Road"" with its possible extension around five meters."	"Ungeachtet dessen wurde dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs mehrheitlich zugestimmt mit der Maßgabe, dass die erforderliche Stützmauer so gebaut wird, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße Richtung ""Bahnhofstraße"" gegebenenfalls für Begegnungsverkehr auf rund 5,5 Meter ausbauen könne."
1262	The erection of the rails at the railway station could actually lead to a whole other problem, which is affecting the trains heading up the steep mountain road.	"The extension of the railways across the Midlands could cause quite another problem for trains heading north, which intersects the steep ""Gerol Station Road""."	"The reopening of the railway network at the railway station might constitute a whole other problem for the railway line, which connects the heavily travelled ""Gerolts Way""."	"Der Umbau des Bahnübergangs bei der Gerberei Trautwein könnte dagegen ein ganz anderes Problem nach sich ziehen, das die Zufahrt in den stark ansteigenden ""Geroltzhäuser Weg"" betrifft."
1263	The management had been considering the layout of the railway at the engineer's office, since they doubted whether the planned extension of the carriageway would be possible.	The authority had been deciding on the plan of the station for the railway, having doubts whether the track to the station would be possible at the time.	The company's plans for the new line had been put off by the engineering office Breinlinger, as they had doubted whether the planned extension of the railway line would be possible.	Die Verwaltung hatte die Umbaupläne der Bahn vom Ingenieurbüro Breinlinger untersuchen lassen, da sie Zweifel daran hatte, ob der geplante Anschluss des Geroltzhäuser Wegs dann noch ohne weiteres möglich sei.
1264	The results of the study found that it is not possible to conclude that the conditions in the road could cause longer cars to sit.	The study concluded that it wasn't enough to conclude that road conditions could lead to longer suspensions of vehicles.	The study found that it's not obvious whether the road conditions could lead to longer traffic on the roads.	Die Untersuchung kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass nicht auszuschließen sei, dass die Neigungsverhältnisse der Straße dazu führen könnten, dass längere Fahrzeuge aufsitzen.
1265	The responsibility for that goes to the city of building a new road.	The responsibility for this part of the city is again falling to the city's overflowing with road construction.	The responsibility for that is on the part of the city.	Die Verantwortung hierfür trage wiederum die Stadt als Straßenbaulastträgerin.
1266	The replacement may prove liability.	The builder could win the case of liability in the future.	The building can soon dispute liability disputes.	Der Umbau könne demnach Haftungsstreitigkeiten nach sich ziehen.
1267	Since both the carriages and the carriages were in running, it was not proper to rely on the railway tracks for improvements, asserted Haa.	A lot of the timber as well as the timber being in the present condition shouldn't be pushed aside for the construction of the railway tracks, argumentated Haa.	Since both the platforms in operation as well as the platforms were still in very good condition, it was agreed that the extension of the railway line shouldn't be interrupted, argumentating Haa.	Da sowohl die Holzabfuhr als auch das Abbiegen im aktuellen Ausbauzustand funktionierten, solle man dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs nicht zustimmen, argumentierte Haas.
1268	The risk of a collision between a stationary vehicle on this platform isn't very high as it was when there was a collision with another train over the same length because the line at the turn-off edge is within good sight.	A crossing this section of the railway is significantly lower than a crossing across the line with a vehicle on the way, because it is situated at the very least near the junction of the track, which provides a good view.	There isn't much risk of a collision between a vehicle on the way over there and another on the other rail tracks, as the line around the station is right across the track, providing a good view.	Auch sei an dieser Stelle das Risiko einer Kollision des Zuges mit einem auf dem Übergang stehenden Fahrzeug deutlich geringer als an den anderen Bahnübergängen, weil sich direkt daneben der Haltepunkt Mitte befinde, zu dem eine gute Sichtverbindung bestehe.
1269	Even half the blocks of the city must have already been cleared so as to prevent a crash.	Even a mile from the centre of town needs to be fenced so that there's no collision.	Even ferns from the mainbahnhof must have already been felled to make sure there are no accidents.	Selbst Züge vom Hauptbahnhof her müssten an dieser Stelle schon soweit abgebremst sein, dass keine Kollision drohe.
1270	"In a majority, the decision to build this extension of the city was rejected, because the city deemed the problem of sitting cars ""must be sorted out"", leaving the tracks free after finishing work."	In principle, the demolition of this track meant the closure of this crossroads because the city had to deal with the problem of standing cars so the trains could be pulled out of service after the works were finished.	The majority of the vote for this tram line was weakened because the city drew the problem of sitting vehicles into play, leaving the railways' responsibility at the end of the work.	"Mehrheitlich wurde dem Umbau dieses Bahnübergangs die Zustimmung verweigert, da die Stadt Schiltach das Problem mit aufsitzenden Fahrzeugen ""ausbaden müsste"", so die Räte, da sich die Bahn nach Abschluss der Bauarbeiten aus der Verantwortung zurückziehen könne."
1271	"Increasingly, the railways' lines cross the ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Kuhbach"", which have already crossed the tracks of the railway station."	"In a problem-free economy, the Union Rail tracks ""Vo Heubach"" and ""Vor Kuhbach"", because they connected railway stations already used to cross the railway tracks."	"In a problematic moment in Greece, the lines ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Kuhbach"" were built on the tracks for the already planned connection to the railway station."	"Als unproblematisch betrachtet das Gremium die Umbauten an den Bahnübergängen ""Vor Heubach"" und ""Vor Kuhbach"", für die bereits Kreuzungsvereinbarungen mit der Bahn getroffen wurden."

1654	They're not all experienced cyclists, they're people on the look for excitement and cost, and a way to become world class organizations.	They aren't all experienced cyclists but people who are searching for joy and earnestness, and looking for a way to World Class Universities.	You are not all experienced runners, but people on a quest for pleasure and riches, looking for a way to World Championships.

We had really fun developing the Defender Challenge weapon – it will become an affordable rivalry.	We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge weapon, it will become an affordable class.	Wir hatten wirklich Spaß daran, den Defender Challenge-Wagen zu entwickeln – das wird eine unterhaltsame Meisterschaft.
1657	Outside of that, Defender Challenge will have a training and testing day in February, while the Option Training and Test Programme takes part in the Wounded Hills in North Africa and the Mid East.

1660	This time we'll assume that an independent Scotland is needed to join the EU-Seek Committee.	This time, we'll expect an independent Scotland to enter the EU as a member state.

1661	This provides the subject of an ancient mystery to Berwick, and a hidden border along the Carpathians Wall.	It's the scientific term for stories of terror across Britain and a walled defence along Hadrian's Wall.	This is the short-cut to stories of conflict in Berwick and a steel-framed border along the Hadrian Wall.	Das liefert das Stichwort für Geschichten über Passkontrollen in Berwick und eine mit Stacheldraht gesicherte Grenze entlang des Hadrianswalls.
1662	In fact, in the straw vote on whether or not there were any economic benefits to open up more freedom of travel in resting Europe, however it was not for those voting in favour of it, having anticipated such a reduction.	In fact, in the Strathclyde-Vorlage a number of economic advantages that would bring about greater freedom of travel in restive Europe were underestimated, but that did not play a role in the banter.	In fact the Strait Council said that there were some economic benefits to increased freedom of travel in resting Europe, but this certainly didn't take into account for the damage done by the floodgates.	In der Tat wurde in der Strathclyde-Vorlage auf die möglichen wirtschaftlichen Vorteile hingewiesen, die mehr Reisefreiheit im restlichen Europa mit sich bringen würde, doch spielte dies – erwartungsgemäß – in den Schlagzeilen keine Rolle.
1663	No one even mentioned that EU-members often adopt strict rules when it is cheaper for them.	Even nobody mentioned that EU members often accept their strict rules when it's cheaper for them.	Nobody even mentioned that EU-members often adopt strict rules when it's cheaper for them.	Auch hat niemand erwähnt, dass sich die EU-Mitgliedsstaaten häufig ihre strikten Regeln zurechtbiegen, wenn es für sie günstiger ist.
1664	Because Scotland is not currently considered the Schengen Road, the proposed non-prohibition would only be a small gesture to encourage Brüssel to do as the Scottish people would wish it.	Currently Scotland isn't participating in the Schengen Convention, so the proposed ban on construction for Brussels would only be a modest departure from the actual Scottish goals.	Since Scotland is not currently a member of the EU, the proposed ban on construction would just act as a little concession to the real state of Berlin.	Da Schottland derzeit nicht zum Schengen-Raum gehört, wäre die fortgesetzte Nichtbeachtung für Brüssel nur ein kleines Zugeständnis im Gegenzug für das, was man wirklich von den Schotten will.
1665	Nothing, actually.	It is not really a story.	No story at all.	Also eigentlich keine Story.
1666	"One, who's already gotten into the habit of being like a fossil for years: The first time I heard the phrase ""Undependence means passport control"" coming from at least 40."

"Und eine, die schon so in der Jahre gekommen ist, dass sie bereits einem Fossil gleicht: Das erste Mal habe ich die „Unabhängigkeit bedeutet Passkontrollen""-Ente vor mindestens 40 Jahren gehört."
1667	That's a particularly interesting point when trying to recover this old story from loss.	There is an interesting point when reviving this old story.	There is a crucial point in constant recall of that strange story.	Dabei geht ein interessanter Punkt beim ständigen Wiederholen dieser uralten Geschichte verloren.
1668	Why should one expect an independent Scotland that it's like the European pen dance?	Why shouldn't we expect from an independent Scotland that it resembles the European piper?	Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that it'll dance like the European piper?	Weshalb sollte man von einem unabhängigen Schottland erwarten, dass es nach der europäischen Pfeife tanzt?
1669	Why does the Londoner Joch clash with that of Brussels, especially now?	Why does London's Jojo stand out from Brussels, particularly now?	Why is London's Jojo opposed to Brussels, especially now?	Warum das Londoner Joch gegen das von Brüssel eintauschen, besonders jetzt?

1671	The project EU officially passed the European Council.	The project Europe was officially terminated with the Euro.	The project Europa has officially stopped in the eurozone.	Mit der Eurokrise ist das Projekt Europa offiziell gestorben.
1672	All across the EU, parties win seats on the ground that eventually wish to become EU members or the Euro is wanted to join the Union.	In the EU all parties win seats on the ground that they want to see as part of the Union, or the Euro is a currency which can be used to secure employment.	All EU parties win presidential elections on the ground that they want to run in the EU or accept the Euro as a regional currency.	Überall in der EU gewinnen Parteien an Boden, die EU-feindlich sind oder den Euro als Gemeinschaftswährung über Bord werfen möchten.
1673	Even in Germany, until this year, the socialist party Alternative for Germany – established almost five million votes cast for themselves in the November election, effectively withdrawing the Liberal Democrats from power.	Even in Germany, the coalition for the euro-democrats – formed only this year – had barely five million votes in the national election in September, thereby driving the libertarian party (that is equal to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.	Even in Germany, the eurosceptic party alternative for Germany – founded just this year – had nearly five million votes to form the opposition bloc in the Federal elections in September, effectively removing the Free Democrats (in short the UK's Liberal Democrats) from the parliament.	Selbst in Deutschland konnte die euroskeptische Partei Alternative für Deutschland – erst dieses Jahr gegründet – knapp fünf Millionen Stimmen bei der Bundestagswahl im September für sich ergattern und damit effektiv die Freien Demokraten (das Äquivalent zu den britischen Liberal Democrats) aus dem Bundestag vertreiben.

1675	The current economic crisis is but a point of departure.	The current economic data but acts as a warning.	The current economic outlook seems to be the key.	Die aktuelle Wirtschaftskrise stellt sich allerdings als Wendepunkt heraus.
1676	The fact that Berlin and the European Central Bank engender strict Sparpolitik in conjunction with the Shanghaijacket, which will affect the national economy of each country through the vote on the forthcoming elections, has led many people to think that the project Europe has gone too far.	Due to the tight fiscal policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, which is expected to improve the domestic economy in the event of the withdrawal from the current economic agreement, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.	Since Berlin and the European Central Bank have taken strict Sparpolitik in conjunction with the national debt, in which the national economy in turn will be strengthened by the tens of thousands supporting the development of the WTO, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.	Wegen der von Berlin und der Europäischen Zentralbank verhängten strengen Sparpolitik in Verbindung mit der Zwangsjacke, in die die jeweilige nationale Wirtschaft durch das Festhalten an der gemeinsamen Währung genötigt wird, sind viele Menschen der Ansicht, das Projekt Europa sei zu weit gegangen.
1677	The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments suffer from excessive deficits in household finances – only in Greece.	The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments have suffered from severe budget cuts — only in Greece.	The crisis of the euro has little to do with the fact that national governments have suffered from excessive budget deficits – not just in Greece.	Die Krise des Euro hat wenig damit zu tun, dass nationale Regierungen exzessive Haushaltsdefizite verursachen – das war nur in Griechenland der Fall.
1678	Statistically, the Eurosystem has highlighted the variations in exchange rates for German exporters – and that german politicians like to do that want to let.	Statistically, the Eurosystem has indexed exchange rates for its members who are heavily German exporters – and they want to let German politicians do it.	Stats indicate the Eurosystem has members set to go head-to-head with exchange rates that are heavily beneficial to German exporters, and that's what German politicians want to let go of.	Stattdessen hat das Eurosystem seine Mitglieder auf Wechselkurse festgenagelt, die für deutsche Exporteure vorteilhaft sind – und das möchten deutsche Politiker gern so lassen.
1679	Without the possibility of a decline in the local currency, South Europe is again facing a rise in productivity.	Without the possibility of a decline in the local currency, South Europe is seeing an increase in productivity against Germany.	Without the possibility of a price hike for the local currency, south Europe has resentment towards Germany in terms of productivity.	Ohne die Möglichkeit einer Abwertung der lokalen Währung findet sich Südeuropa mit einem eingebauten Produktivitätsnachteil gegenüber Deutschland wieder.
1680	The only possible solution is to cut back taxes and cuts – spread out from Berlin.	The only way to cut back costs is by cutting them and cutting public expenditures - a trend found from Berlin.	The only possible solution is to cut back wages and spending from Berlin.	Die einzige Möglichkeit besteht darin, Löhne und öffentliche Ausgaben zu kürzen – angespornt von Berlin.
1681	A deeper problem is the current state of the economy in Europe.	Under the current shortage of workers and wages there's a deepening problem of productivity in Europe.	There is a deepening problem of the current market and wages in Europe.	Hinter den aktuellen Etat- und Währungsproblemen liegt ein tiefer gehendes europäisches Produktivitätsproblem.
1682	"As a result of the adoption by Brussels of ""green"" energy schemes – a code for subsidiation of French and German energy companies on account of the consumer – the European industrial sector pay the double for electricity and the fourth for gas to the United States."	Having adopted Brussels' green energy policy – a code to subsidise the production of electricity by French and German firms on behalf of consumers –, the European industry pays the double for electricity and the fourth for gas in comparison with the US.	As a result of the adoption of green energy directives by Brussels – a code for the subsidy of the energy industry to the benefit of the consumer – the European Union calculates the double for electricity and the four times for gas in comparison with the United States.	"Als Folge der von Brüssel verordneten „grünen"" Energierichtlinien – ein Code für die Subventionierung französischer und deutscher Energieunternehmen auf Kosten der Verbraucher – zahlt die europäische Industrie verglichen mit den Vereinigten Staaten das Doppelte für Elektrizität und das Vierfache für Gas."
1683	This is a cheap cost, as we saw in Glastonbury.	It's a cheaper cost, as we saw it already in Gauteng.	This is a lower-cost alternative to what we saw in Grangemouth.	Das ist ein lähmender Kostennachteil, wie wir bereits in Grangemouth sehen konnten.
1684	All the Holocaust-era warnings in the world don't protect the European petrochemical industry from being overloaded by cheap American electricity.

Nach dem Krieg sah die politische Elite Frankreichs die EU als ein Vehikel, mit dem man Deutschland in Schach halten und Paris auf Augenhöhe mit Washington heben konnte.
1687	But Paris needs no more than a Tor to political legitimacy and has made the EU its own economic policy by fighting the unsuccessful French economy.	But Paris doesn't need Paris more than any political legitimacy, and Europe has declared its own economic policy aimed at fighting the struggling French economy.	But Paris doesn't need Paris more than a platform for political legitimacy and has set up its own economic policy with the aid of the downed French economy.	Doch Berlin braucht Paris nicht mehr als Tor zur politischen Legitimation und hat Europa seine eigene Wirtschaftspolitik aufgedrückt, womit die angeschlagene französische Wirtschaft zu kämpfen hat.
1688	The result: Martha Le Pen's just judged the EU-backed Front National has just won a decisive election, convincing the socialists to seat three.	The result: in appeal, the European Parliament-backed Front National has just won a crucial election and managed to defeat the regents on the third spot.	The result: Appellate judge Mary Le Pen, the European Front National has just won a crucial election and led the ruling Socialists to seat three.	Das Ergebnis: Marine Le Pens rechtsgerichteter, EU-feindlicher Front National hat gerade eine entscheidende Nachwahl gewonnen und damit die regierenden Sozialisten auf Platz drei verwiesen.

A timely warning for the British Labour Party that they can't talk about a split in the right direction would mean benefits to the linkages.	Der Front National ist nun die beliebteste Partei in Frankreich mit 24 Prozent der Wählerstimmen – eine zeitgerechte Warnung für die britische Labour-Partei, dass sie nicht davon ausgehen kann, eine Spaltung im rechten Spektrum würde automatisch Vorteile für die Linke bedeuten.

1692	If the anti-EU coalitions are really well represented in these elections – and this is very good possible – then they could finally dominate the European Parliament.

"Airbus says its Rivale follows a seating scheme from the 1950s when the average height of the newly-drewn ""Jet Set"" was slightly over 350m."	"Airbus sagt, sein Rivale halte sich an ein Sitzkonzept aus den 1950ern, als der durchschnittliche Körperumfang des frisch getauften „Jet Set"" schmaler war."
1874	Airbus carried out studies that showed that an additional two inches (2,54 cm) for each seat improved the sleep quality by 53 percent.	Airbus carried out an air quality test which showed that an additional tonne (254 cm) per person affected the sleep of 53 percent.	Airbus carried out studies that found that an additional 2.5 cm of stomach fat per snort was three percent better than average.	Man habe, so Airbus, Untersuchungen durchgeführt, die belegten, dass ein zusätzliches Zoll (2,54 cm) pro Sitz die Schlafqualität um 53 Prozent steigere.
1875	Boeing disputes the number of seats in an agreement with Airbus and says it is not in the manufacturer's opinion how to balance their flight plan and its operations.	Boeing disputes Airbus's numbers on the number of seats, saying it's not reasonable for manufacturers to make a decision about how to balance seating and cabin layout.	Boeing challenges the seating measurements of Airbus and says that it's beyond the manufacturer to decide how airline employees can manage baggage and facilities.	Boeing bestreitet die Zahlen von Airbus zu den Sitzmaßen und sagt, es stehe nicht im Ermessen der Hersteller zu entscheiden, wie Fluggesellschaften die Balance zwischen Flugtarifen und Einrichtung gestalten.
1876	The company also says the experience in an airplane is different from its seats width.	The company says the experience on board the plane is lower than the width of the seat.	The company says, according to tests, the experience in a plane varies between the width of the seats and that of the passengers.	Das Unternehmen erklärt auch, laut Untersuchungen hänge das Erlebnis im Flugzeug von mehr als der Sitzbreite ab.
1877	"It really depends on the freedom of flight so that they can do what they have to do in order to be successful"", says the airline's aviation expert Kent Craver from Boeing."	It really boils down to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they need to achieve success, explains the flight engineer from Boeing.	"It really comes down to giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they need to do to succeed,"" says the flight controller of Boeing, Kent Craver."	"„Es läuft wirklich darauf hinaus, Fluggesellschaften Flexibilität zu geben, damit sie das tun können, was sie ihrer Ansicht nach müssen, um erfolgreich zu sein"", erläutert der Flugkabinenexperte Kent Craver von Boeing."
1878	They don't want us to dictate what they can do profitably.	They don't want us to dictate what they can do profitably.	You don't want us to dictate what they do profitably.	Sie möchten nicht, dass wir ihnen diktieren, was sie profitabel macht.
1879	You know her business better than anyone else does.	They know her business better than anyone else does.	You know her business better than anyone else does.	Sie kennen ihr Geschäft besser als jeder andere.
1880	For air passengers it's about less skin on the surface, but for manufacturers it'll become a subject that they can influence the outcome in increasingly large quantities.	Airplanes prefer the crowding out more passengers, but manufacturers will increasingly consider it a subject that can influence the amendments.	For flyers it's about fewer crowdings, but for manufacturers it'll become a subject that can influence changes in terms of industry.	Für Fluggäste geht es um mehr Ellenbogenfreiheit, aber für Hersteller wird es in zunehmendem Maße ein Thema, das sich auf die Umsätze auswirken kann.
1881	In the aftermath of the conflict, a recession in the production of airframes is forecasted to cost around 700 billion US dollar in the next decade, as the extent of the impact on the export market of the USA or Europe continues to be enormous.	A new breed of aircraft is emerging in the rear of the conversation, with an estimated volume of about 700 billion US dollar in the future, which could affect the export value of the United States or Europe.	In the background of the tension is a rally about airspace; with a projected volume of at least 700 billion US dollars in the next decade, the price of which could be durable for the US export market or Europe's export revenue.	Hinter der Auseinandersetzung steht ein Rennen um Flugzeugbestellungen mit einem geschätzten Volumen von mindestens 700 Milliarden US-Dollar nach Listenpreisen in den kommenden Jahrzehnten, was sich nachhaltig auf die Exportbilanz der USA oder Europas auswirken könnte.
1882	According to the first paper in July, the layout of the meeting is the driving force behind the introduction of the new jets.	For the first time since July, the floor plan is the driving force behind the new jets' configuration.	How this paper reported the layout of the meeting is the driving force behind the new jets' merger.	Wie Reuters im Juli erstmals berichtete, ist das Sitzlayout die treibende Kraft hinter der Auseinandersetzung um die neuen Jets.
1883	Both Airbus and Boeing expect to achieve 20 percent more efficiency a year on their new two-motor long distance rockets than the leader in this segment, the Boeing 787-300ER, which has three-heads.	Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent increase in efficiency on their latest two-motor long-distance trains than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER.	Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency on their latest two-motor long-range vehicles than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.	Sowohl Airbus als auch Boeing behaupten 20 Prozent mehr Effizienz pro Sitz bei ihren neuesten zweimotorigen Langstreckendesigns als der Marktführer in diesem Segment, die 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER.
1884	The results of the announcements by Boeing vary with the fact that the 777X with its ten seats original will be compared with nine seats in the 777.	Boeing's prediction about the results partly stems from the fact that the Boeing 777 with its ten seats in a row will be a new version of the original design.	Boeing's predictions about the results are partly driven by the fact that the Boeing 777X with its original design will be replaced by nine seats on the 747.	Die Aussagen Boeings zu den Ergebnissen hängen teilweise davon ab, dass die 777X mit ihren zehn Sitzen pro Reihe mit dem Originaldesign von neun Sitzen in der 777 verglichen wird.
1885	The cost of living per unit is still lower than the ten-seater model used for generating power.	The cost of a unit has never been lower than it was for conventional machines with ten seats per row.	The costs for one unit are still lower than the cost of one currently used machines with ten seats.	Die gestiegenen Kosten pro Einheit sind immer noch geringer als bei derzeit verwendeten Maschinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe.
1886	"By folding his planes, it becomes easier to compete with our products,"" says Kevin Keniston, managing director of the European Airbus."	"As a result, Boeing is limiting its seats to make them more competitive with our competitors' products,"" says Kevin Keniston, the head of the passenger comfort department at the European Airbus."	Airbus is considering deploying more seats in its airplane to make it competitive with our products, says Kevin Keniston, head of the airline's passenger seat.	"„Boeing quetscht deshalb mehr Sitze in sein Flugzeug, um es wettbewerbsfähiger zu unseren Produkten zu machen"", sagt Kevin Keniston, Leiter für Passagierkomfort bei der europäischen Airbus."
1887	Meanwhile, analysts say that even when there were ten seats for all the aircraft on board the existing jets they thought there were plenty of passengers who would want to use cheaper airline tickets.	Andererseits, analysts say all the cabins with ten seats on existing Boeings predicted that many passengers would prefer cheaper planes to smaller ones.	A while back, analysts said full planes with ten seats on board the existing 777 said they thought that many passengers would opt for the cheaper route.	Andererseits sagen Analysten, volle Kabinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe bei vorhandenen 777s deuteten darauf hin, dass sich viele Passagiere für die engere Anordnung entschieden, was mit billigeren Flugtarifen einhergehen könnte.
1888	A mere ten cubic feet would be great for passengers, but the reality is that when it comes to commercial aircraft, the Airbus Business Unit's technical director and runway girl network founder says she wants to control the fleet by a single plane.	Airbus's offering of eighteen cubic inches of seating is great for passengers, but the reality is that this is a strategic facet of the business: It is the Airbus network which is the founding partner of Runway Girl Network.	A further eight feet of seats would be useful for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, Airbus is flying the 777 from the cabin, said Mary Kirby, expert on cabin operations, founder and chief executive of Runway Girl Network.	"„Achtzehn Zoll Sitzbreite wären toll für Passagiere, aber die Wirklichkeit ist: von einem wirtschaftlichen Gesichtspunkt aus ist das Airbus-Angebot von der Bedrohung durch die 777 gesteuert"", sagt Mary Kirby, Expertin für Kabineneinrichtung, Gründerin und Herausgeberin von Runway Girl Network."
1889	Airbus and Boeing have no seats on board, but a catalogue of suppliers which can be sourced from the airlines.	Airbus and Boeing do not have seats, but a catalogue of suppliers that you can pick from the airline companies.	Airbus and Boeing don't offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.	Airbus und Boeing bieten keine Sitze an, sondern einen Katalog von Zulieferern, aus denen die Fluggesellschaften auswählen können.
1890	Those flying jets taking the world away must take some measure to match the competition.	The world-traveling jet aircraft operators strictly follow regulations to measure their performance against the competition.	The world traveller jetpackers are taking particular care when they advertise their services to competitors.	Die weltreisenden Jet-Verkäufer tragen sogar Bandmaß bei sich, um die Einrichtung bei der Konkurrenz nachzumessen.
1891	Even though they offer the price of comfort, all manufacturers still offer jets with highly refined styling for airline services and regional flights.	Even though they offer the price of comfort, all manufacturers still offer high-speed jets for a domestic flight and regional flights.	Even though they charge for the comfort, all manufacturers still offer high-quality jets for a commercial flight and regional travel.	Selbst wenn sie den Komfort anpreisen, so bieten doch alle Hersteller auch Jets mit hochverdichteter Ausgestaltung für Billigfluglinien und regionale Flüge.
1892	Airbus offers a fleet of eight A350s, but according to its own statement, neither has Airbus ever sold any yet.	Airbus offers a class A350, but according to its own statement no variant has yet been sold.	Airbus is offering an A350 with ten seaters but hasn't yet sold it out of its own statement.	Airbus bietet einen A350 mit zehnsitzigen Reihen, hat aber laut eigener Aussage noch keinen verkauft.
1893	Airbus has previously stressed the importance of accessibility to the cabins and seats are offered in some jets for generous flights.	Airbus hasn't commented until recently on the importance of making use of the cabins and allowing passenger seat changes on some jets.	Airbus has said recently that it is important for cabins to be accessible and some jets offer wide seats on the roost.	Bis vor kurzem hat Airbus betont, wie wichtig mehr Anpassbarkeit der Kabinen sei und für einige Jets breite Sitze an den Gängen angeboten.
1894	Although only one or two jets produce large modern jets, experts say that the reputation of a new branch standard will probably die, but the demand for it could be lifted by the availability of 777X-companies.	Without the support of only a few other manufacturers, big modern jets are saying experts expect that the reputation for introducing new branch standards will decline, but the well-being of 777X buyers may be mitigated by the use of this new standard.	Without the support of one or two other manufacturers, large modern jets say that they might be able to push back the reputation of a new branch standard, but it may well be able to compete against the tide of 777X buyers.	Ohne die Unterstützung des einzigen anderen Herstellers großer moderner Jets sagen Experten, dass der Ruf nach einem neuen Branchenstandard vermutlich verpuffen werde, aber von der Welle von 777X-Verkäufen ablenken könnte.
1895	Veganism, as the Lexikon says, differs from vegetarianism in a way but is quite substantial.	Veganism, as the Lexicon says, differs from vegetarianism in quite a way.	Veganism, according to Lexika Vegetarianism, differs from that in quite a way.	Der Veganismus ist laut Lexika dem Vegetarismus unterstellt, unterscheidet sich von diesem aber doch auf ganz erhebliche Weise.
1896	Since vegetarians who prefer salt, ice or an acidic dressing do not put these fish on the menu of vegans.	For vegetarians who refuse to eat steamed vegetables, ice cream or a strong carrot will not put these gummy bear on the menu of vegans.	Although vegetarians use the ingredients of sahne, ice or strong seeds to flavour their meals, these bad foods aren't included on vegan plates.	Denn während Vegetarier sich den Verzehr von Sahnetorte, Eis oder einem kräftigen Edamer erlauben, stehen diese Schlemmereien nicht auf der Speisekarte eines Veganers.
1897	Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the rationing of animal products, vegans are also prohibited from using any animal products, like meat, eggs, soy, etc.	Milk, cheese, egg, to add to the fats in your diet, vegans are being forbidden all kinds of dairy products - even honey.	Milk, cheese and eggs aside from the vegetarian diet of meat and fish gives vegans all sorts of animal products - also honey.	Milch, Käse, Ei, neben den Verzicht auf Fleisch und Fisch lässt der Veganer vom sämtlichen Verzehr tierischer Produkte ab - auch Honig wird verneint.
1898	What remains, one might ask, but closer to home, the vegan diet is marked by a beachy ingredient list.	You might ask what remains, but closer to home, the vegan diet is characterized by a beachy infall.	While much may remain to be wondered, a closer look at vegan food presents a striking one.	Was bleibt, mag man sich fragen, doch bei näherer Betrachtung zeichnet sich die vegane Ernährungswelt durch einen beachtlichen Einfallsreichtum aus.
1899	Barbecues are very popular, explained Ute Henkelmann, the host of the healthy reform house which makes a large variety of vegan friendly products.	Brothcuts are very popular, says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the historic reform building that produces a great deal of special products for vegans.	Broth coatings are popular, says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the historic Reform Building which makes a wide variety of vegan products.	"""Brotaufstriche sind sehr beliebt"", erklärt Ute Henkelmann, die Inhaberin des hiesigen Reformhauses, die eine Vielzahl spezieller Produkte für Veganer bereithält."

1901	"Since 13 years, vegans in the poorest of New Zealand, he practically finds everything he needs to live. ""1997 put my food on and became vegetarian""."	"Having lived vegan for 13 years, he in Lampertheim finds almost everything that he needs to live. ""In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian""."	"For 13 years, vegan in the backpack of New Zealanders, he finds almost everything that he needs to live. ""In 1997 I put my food on and became vegetarian""."	"Seit 13 Jahren lebt der gebürtige Neuseeländer vegan, in Lampertheim findet er (fast) alles vor, was er zum Leben braucht. ""1997 stellte ich meine Ernährung um und wurde Vegetarier""."
1902	At the turn of the century, the next step took place, and I became vegan.	The next step in the century went, and I became vegan.	A little while ago, the next step was and I became vegan.	Um die Jahrhundertwende erfolgte dann der nächste Schritt und ich wurde Veganer.
1903	But evidence did not come just because of diet, but because of the shoe choice, says Proctor, who says that the traditional leathersmith prefers to use.	The proof was not just for food, but it was from the choice of shoes, says Proctor, an art dealer that uses normal leather.	The proof was not just for food but also because of the shoe selection, says Proctor, who says that the art director prefers normal leather.	"""Die Überzeugung kam aber nicht nur wegen der Ernährung, sondern aufgrund der Schuhwahl"", sagt Proctor, der Kunstleder normalem Leder vorzieht."
1904	He knew that it doesn't exist in other everyday purchases without quality products.	He realized it's not enough to buy expensive products in other everyday businesses.	He realized that it's not possible to buy premium products in other everyday shops.	Er erkannte, dass es auch in anderen alltäglichen Belangen ohne tierische Produkte geht.
1905	Vegan in the first place is a vegetarian.	Vegan in the first place is vegan.	Vegan in the first place is an edible.	In erster Linie ist vegan sein eine Ethik.
1906	"""I don't want to die of animal cruelty"", says Proctor, the head and tail of the Vegan Association, which are scandalous for its behaviour."	Prohibit killing animals that ruin my diet, says Proctor, the maximum vegan that eats nothing but fruit.	"""I don't want animals to die for me,"" says Proctor, the most highly regarded vegan who concocts an awful behaviour on the whole scale."	"""Ich will nicht, dass Tiere für mich sterben müssen"", spricht Proctor die Maxime der Veganer aus, die sich auf das gesamte Konsumverhalten erstreckt."
1907	Scattered by burgers, sausages or vegetable sauces, vegans quickly discovered entirely new products that would soon be popular.	Whether it was burgers, ravines or garlands that were behind vegans, vegans quickly discovered all kinds of new products, the demand for which expanded to more than just meat.	When you think about fries, sauces or bears, vegans quickly found completely new products and the demand for them grew.	Statt Burgern, Rühreiern oder Gummibären hinterherzutrauern, habe der Veganer schnell ganz neue Produkte entdeckt, die Begeisterung stieg an.
1908	"It's a double bonus, says Proctor today, ""preserving vegan doesn't mean vice versa, it's a way of thinking; it's a health issue."" The assumption that vegetarians are limited in choosing their meals puts proctor back to his habitual life."	The idea that you are changing your diet and choosing what foods to eat increases the likelihood of a success. However, Proctor hopes that the suggestion that vegans are not rationalized but rather an option to try out for themselves, in turn turning back the population.	Proctor says he's getting a double bonus because vegans aren't necessarily selfish, nor are vegetarians allowed, but rather as a matter of preference, they get back to town work.	"""Es ist ein doppelter Bonus"", sagt Proctor heute, ""tatsächlich stellt vegan sein keinen Verzicht, keine Askese dar, sondern es ist eine Bereicherung"". Die Annahme, dass man mit der Ernährungsumstellung die Auswahl an Speiseoptionen reduziere, führt Proctor eher auf die Macht der Gewohnheit zurück."
1909	And precisely these conditions kept some people from making even so good attempts.	And precisely these concessions allowed some, still not so good at least, to attempt.	And exactly these conditions allowed some less well-meaning experimentaries to fail.	Und genau diese Konditionierungen ließen auch manchen noch so gut gemeinten Versuch scheitern.
1910	The factors that make up the search for a person are very important factors that can make up a lot of fires, such as smoking, says Proctor.	"The quality of the work is a very important factor, which makes up a lot of rapid changes, just like smoke does"", Proctor puts it into context."	The factor of choice is a highly variable factor that can affect our mood, as when smoking, says Proctor.	"""Der Suchtfaktor ist ein ganz entscheidender Faktor, der viele schnell aufgeben lässt, ähnlich wie beim Rauchen"", stellt Proctor einen Vergleich auf."
1911	And I say to myself: Best-to-be mice aren't ready for use on animals.	And just a word goes out: Best-ear squirrels are not easily distinguished from other mammals.	"And one finisher says ""Best flowers are not stuck on the animals""."	"Und wendet ein: ""Bestimmte Geschmäcker sind nicht am Tier festzumachen""."
1912	It is often the wines or the way of cooking that change the taste.	It's often the flavours or the way in which food binds to your taste.	There are often cocktails or dishes that separate the taste.	Oft sind es die Gewürze oder die Art der Zubereitung, die den Geschmack ausmachen.
1913	The vegans claim that you can achieve the same effect by other means.	"""You can achieve the same effect but in another way"", explains the vegan."	You can achieve the same effect in another way, explain the vegan.	"""Man kann aber auch auf andere Weise den gleichen Effekt erzeugen"", verdeutlicht der Veganer."
1914	If you're going to a barbecue, there are some onions, champignons, and a few vegan chips.	A steak with grilled onions, mushrooms and vegan topping is a recipe for a grillfest.	In a barbecue, prosciutto like apples, plums and even some vegan cheeses come with it.	Zu einem Grillfest bringt Proctor beispielsweise Auberginen, Champignons und auch ein paar Veganwürste mit.
1915	He eats an all-natural diet, which he says will ensure that he gets well.	He focuses on a balanced, unspoiled diet, which he should at least once make a delicious meal.	He is watching a well-balanced diet, which he hopes will boost the appetite.	Er achtet auf eine ausgewogene, abwechslungsreiche Ernährung, bei der es durchaus auch einmal deftig schmecken soll.
1916	Of course, something between the teeth must be legitimized.	Of course, anything between the teeth would do something legit.	You have something between your teeth, right?	Natürlich möchte man etwas zwischen den Zähnen haben, das ist legitim.
1917	It is supposed to help, but it is not just a matter of reducing unhealthy food, according to Proctor.	It's meant to cool, but that doesn't just reduce eating from animal feed, says Proctor.	That's supposed to sooth, but this is not just about reducing starches, says Proctor.	"""Es soll schmecken, aber das ist nicht nur auf tierische Nahrung zu reduzieren"", so Proctor."
1918	After suffering from a virus, he did not respond.	As far as health damages go to AIDS, a further widespread offer of care did not have any effect on his recovery.	In addition to the serious health risks, a further broad-based claim had not been met.	Gesundheitliche Schäden bis hin zu Essstörungen, eine weitere weitverbreitete Annahme, habe er nicht erlitten.

1923	In particular, the warnings from vitamin B12 are coming in many vegan cooks.	In particular before the sun, many vegans warn of vitamin B12.	In particular before Christmas, many vegans warn of vitamin B12.	Insbesondere vor dem Mangel an Vitamin B12 warnen viele Vegansimus-Kritiker.
1924	"In places where animal feed is used, frogs are to be nucleated instead of wheat. ""I wonder whether in the meat one buys at the butcher's is the percentage of vitamin B12 in the food it grows,"" says Proctor."	'Tiers which are fed with furnaces are starting to take on weight than those which are being grown on the skin, say Proctor.	'Teens that consume flour are getting used instead of eating the meat from the winter coop, say Proctor.	"""Da Tiere mit Futtermitteln genährt werden, statt auf der Weide zu grasen, ist es fraglich, ob in dem Fleisch, das man in der Kühltruhe kauft, der Vitamin-B12-Anteil hoch ist"", findet Proctor."
1925	Vegans may use the mixture in form of tablets.	Vegans will be able to take the enzyme in tablets.	For vegans, it is possible to take the patented product in tablet form.	Für Veganer gebe es zudem die Möglichkeit, das Coenzym in Form von Tabletten zu sich zu nehmen.

1928	There are basic ingredients everywhere, and now every supermarket has soaps and other products.	Starting from nowhere, the supermarket has now almost all sorts of soup and other products.	Everywhere there is basic ingredients and every supermarket now has drinks and other products.	Grundnahrungsmittel gibt es schließlich überall und jeder Supermarkt hat mittlerweile Sojamilch und andere Produkte.
1929	Everything I need, I'll find it here.	All I need is to find an area.	Anything I need, I'll find it.	Alles, was ich brauche, finde ich vor Ort.
1930	All I'm doing is buy some spices.	I'll just buy some stuff at home.	I'll only buy some pasta from here.	Nur ab und an kaufe ich etwas Spezielles.
1931	"Some people assume that only the fertile products are expensive, but this applies to ""normal"" fertilizers, too."""	A lot of people forget that even the most expensive fruits are expensive, but it doesn't mean much for the more stirred ones.	"Many people overlook that even the best fertilizers are expensive, but it's also known about ""geothermal fertilizers""."	"""Viele Leute übersehen, dass eben nur die Fertigprodukte teuer sind, aber so verhält es sich bei ""gewöhnlichen"" Fertigprodukten bekanntermaßen auch""."
1932	Vegan food is far cheaper and less time-consuming than conventionally prepared.	Vegan recipes are a lot cheaper and less time-consuming than traditional ones.

1934	Making pies instead of butter, a little more starchy and sorbent-free than eggs, using his vegan cheesecake to make his queer food stand.	Using yogurt instead of butter, a little bit more acidity and vitamin C in lieu of egg, Proctor was able to turn his struggling carrot into mash by using his vegan cheesecakes.	Rather than butter, more acidic fats and cobwebs than eggs, Proctor's vegan cheesecake could make his spitting gum, too.	Margarine statt Butter, etwas mehr Backpulver und Kohlensäure statt Ei, mit seinen veganen Käsekuchen konnte Proctor auch seine Schwiegereltern zum Staunen bringen.
1935	Vegans get a new taste with family fun.	Vegans can enjoy family festivals a new breed of wildlife.	Vegans don't have to make any change to their diet.	Familienfesten verleiht der Veganer eine neue Würze.

"""Die Situationen, die dabei entstehen können, sind so unterschiedlich wie die Menschen selbst"", sagt Proctor."
1938	Of course, he was treated with Skepsis.	Of course he was beaten to the bone but also to the cobwebs.	Not only was he helped get the word out, but he had already got sick.	Natürlich wurde ihm aber auch schon Skepsis entgegengebracht.
1939	Don't you buy my food anymore?	Don't you stop my food?	Aren't you eating my food anymore?	Schmeckt dir mein Essen nicht mehr?
1940	Do you want me to feel bad now that I drink milk? Those kinds of questions require you to apply your fingertip reflex.	Would you like me to feel bad now because I drink milk? You need to accept the fact that vegans have fingerspitzengefühls when asking questions like that.	Should I feel bad now because I drink milk? If you're asking vegans, you've got to admit that you're a vegan with a penchant for eating.	"""Soll ich mich jetzt schlecht fühlen, weil ich Milch trinke?"" - bei solcherlei Fragen müsse man als Veganer mit Fingerspitzengefühl agieren."
1941	I don't tolerate people, I'm part of this company. Don't want to be sued by anybody.	"I don't envy people, I am part of this company"" Proctor will not renew the contract."	I don't want to shame people, I'm part of this society, so I can't sign an agreement.	"""Ich lehne die Menschen ja nicht ab, ich bin Teil dieser Gesellschaft"", möchte Proctor kein Enklavendasein fristen."
1942	If you take a closer look, everyday life does not seem as vegan as it may appear, and vegans aren't restricted as commonly accepted.	In closer examination, the everyday world isn't as vegan as we might think, and vegans aren't restricted to living in the same way they are marginalized.	And more generally, the everyday world is not as vegan as you think it is, and the vegan doesn't get excluded as an individual in the mainstream.

In a pizza restaurant, he'll serve pasta or pizza without cheese, it's a matter of habit.	In a pizza place he orders pasta and bread, or just orders pizza without cheese. All this is a matter of habit.	In einer Pizzeria weicht er auf Pastagerichte aus, oder bestellt eben eine Pizza ohne Käse, alles eine Frage der Gewohnheit.
1947	The restaurants put on such slow plates.	The restaurants set their pace.	The restaurants are such slow to react.	Die Restaurants stellen sich so langsam darauf ein.

"In „Double Down"" wird behauptet, Daley habe an der Spitze der Bemühungen gestanden, Biden trotz ihres „engen, persönlichen Verhältnisses"" auszutauschen, ehe man sich schließlich gegen einen solchen Schachzug entschied, nachdem die Daten zeigten, dass die Kandidatur Clintons „die Chancen Obamas nicht maßgeblich verbessern"" würde."

Campaigns won't spend so much money on surveys and focus groups if you don't give attention to anything in the past, explained Martin on AC360.

2894	This was evident at the beginning of the year 2012 account.	This was clearly seen in the forecast for 2012.	That was clearly made clear in the year-end statement for 2012.	Dies wurde bei der Vorstellung der Jahresrechnung für 2012 deutlich.

2897	To be grateful, the excise taxes on trade and the municipal income tax are all subject to raises.	To be appreciated, the income tax is covered under the current law in favor of higher wages and the town bond.	To appreciate the contribution of the community to the tax bill, the VAT increase was significantly higher than usual.	Zu verdanken sei der Überschuss vor allem höheren Gewerbesteuereinnahmen und dem Gemeindeanteil an der Einkommenssteuer.

2900	This relates to the higher government spending, said Rothmund.	Almost all this sits with the higher rate of income from the budget allocation, said Rothmund.	In a way that, Mr. Roth said, it appears that this amount is headed in the direction of higher spending from the budget.	"""Dies liegt im Wesentlichen an der höheren Zuführung aus dem Verwaltungshaushalt"", so Rothmund."
2901	Because there were fewer investment activities planned for 2012, the response times have been higher.	Because there were less investment in the budget for 2012 than originally planned, the refunds remained higher.	In the budget year 2012, there were less investments than originally planned, therefore the costs for restructuring were higher.	Da im Haushaltsjahr 2012 weniger Investitionen als geplant getätigt worden sind, ist auch die Rücklagenzuführung höher ausgefallen.

2908	That's why many Gerbers have used to take refuge from the country.	That's why some people have been saying that they've gotten sicker and sicker from the country.	That's why the Germans have often been forced to take refuge from the country.	Dadurch wiederum seien aber laut Gerster schon öfters Zuschüsse vom Land gekürzt worden.

We need to consider the question of whether we should invest in the next few years for which we would like some sweets, said Gerard about it.	We must address the subject of welfare; there are investments that we would like to invest in the future, the spokesman said.

2938	I'm of the opinion that a lot of promises were made by the party politics blocade, so that some things should have been put forward for our nation: constitutional amendments, an option for public health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay to name only a few.	I am also of the opinion that the banter between left-wing blocadets should have been reduced to many lesser measures, including constitutional reform, an option for public health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, just to name a few.

2941	The Russian Blockade cannot explain why the arrest of foreign nationals for terrorism or the execution of innocent children by murder.	Republikan blockade cannot explain why it is ok to block off foreign nationals' states or to prevent the murder of innocent children through murder.	The republican blockade can't explain why the refusal of foreign nationals to host dictators or the killing of innocent children through murder.

2942	It's impossible to explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of American adults and why whistleblowers are urged to report wrong behaviour.	It can't be explained why the National Security Agency gathers data about the personal lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are encouraged to report the state's wrong behavior.	It's impossible to explain why the National Security Agency gathers data on American private lives and why whistleblowers are being advised to report the lack of behaviour of the state.

2943	Why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was executed without trial, yet still are the cuts to public funds and contributions made during the presidential election.	There's no way of explaining why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was executed without trial, and yet why the limits of public funding and expenditure during the presidential election were set at random.	Why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was executed without prosecution, yet why the limits for funding and expenditures would be raised during the presidential election.

2945	Even the newest isn't to blame for having built a simple website more than three years since the end of Affordable Care Act.	Even if we can't justify the lack of capacity to create a simple website more than three years after the repeal of Affordable Care Act, it's not enough for us to condemn the lack of ability to do that.	Even if it has not been enough for the administration of the Affordable Care Act to offer an easy website for more than three years after the adoption of the Affordable Care Act, it can't be denied that it is incapacity to overcome the lack of funds to fund it.

2948	On the contrary, the committee has no future plans for a revolution as opposition parties and surprising events such as Newtown's massacre feature in the public debate.	The committee on organising events isn't likely to go ahead without taking an opinion poll, in which an opposition party and sudden events like the Newtown massacre are at the forefront.	No coherent course is under way in which the executive committee functions, as opposed to a coalition and random events like Newtown Massacre are predicated on public discussion.	Offensichtlich ist das Abgeordnetenamt kein vorhersehbarer Kurs, da eine Oppositionspartei und zufällige Ereignisse wie das Newtown-Massaker die öffentliche Diskussion prägen.
2949	But when I look at the examples above, they seem far from being elected by the government.	But when I look at the above examples, they seem far away from being elected by the government themselves.
