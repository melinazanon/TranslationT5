1269	Even trains from the main station must have already been sunk so that there isn't a collision.	The only thing that needs to be done at this place is to make sure that there's no litter.	Apparently even trains from the main station have already been rigged to ensure that there isn't a collision.	Selbst Züge vom Hauptbahnhof her müssten an dieser Stelle schon soweit abgebremst sein, dass keine Kollision drohe.
