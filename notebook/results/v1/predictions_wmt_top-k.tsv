980	"Prof. Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient said: ""It is well known that the brain stems react differently to stimuli, so positive or negative emotions can arise."""	In practice, the brainstem and the cingulates are different on stimuli, so it's well known that the limbic nervous system reacts differently to stimuli, producing positive or negative emotions.	It is well known that the left and right brains in humans react differently to stimuli, causing positive or negative emotions.	"Professor Georgio Vallortigara, ein Neurowissenschaftler der Universität Trient, sagte: „Beim Menschen ist gut bekannt, dass die linke und rechte Gehirnhälfte unterschiedlich auf Stimuli reagieren, die positive oder negative Emotionen hervorrufen."""

985	We should soon realize why the lion sometimes moves in one direction and again, in another.

We'll probably soon get to know why the swing goes in one direction and sometimes in another.	Wahrscheinlich werden wir bald verstehen, warum sich der Schwanz mal in die eine, mal in die andere Richtung bewegt
986	"Professor Vallortiara said: ""We showed the dogs some movies - either a nature-based version or a silent one, so as to remove distractive effects, and thus, the wings could move closer or downwards."""	Professor Vallortigara said: We've shown the dog films with dogs either a natural version or splice, so that we could remove some of the subtleties, and thus the movement of the brains will be able to steer more towards left or right.	Professor Vallortigara said: We've shown some dogs animated shorts – either a natural version or a silhouette, so as to distract from other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the brains more towards left or right.	"Professor Vallortigara sagte: „Wir haben den Hunden Filme mit Hunden gezeigt – entweder eine naturgetreue Version oder eine Silhouette, um ablenkende andere Aspekte zu eliminieren, und wir konnten damit die Bewegung des Schwanzes mehr nach links oder rechts steuern."""
987	When the animals saw how a normally low-profile dog moved to the left (from the perspective of the wet dogs), they were completely relaxed.	Seeing the way a otherwise unseen dog moved vertically (from the perspective of the wet dogs), they were entirely relaxed.	When the animals looked as a potentially stressed dog moving to the right (from the perspective of the wet dogs), they were all completely relaxed.	Wenn die Tiere sahen, wie ein ansonsten ausdrucksloser Hund den Schwanz nach rechts bewegt hat (von der Perspektive des wedelnden Hundes aus gesehen), blieben sie völlig entspannt.
988	But the tension mainly grew closer when, in another way, the dog barking, her heart rate went up, and she turned pale.	Although the trembling gradually turned to links (from the perspective of the dog, who was weaning), her heart rate climbed and she looked disorganized.	But the tension gradually turned to left (from perspective of the dog, who was walking), so her heart rate climbed and she looked unhurt.	War aber die Schwanzneigung vornehmlich nach links (wieder aus Perspektive des Hundes, der wedelt), so stieg ihre Herzfrequenz und sie sahen unruhig aus.
989	According to Prof. Vallortigara, the dogs don't intentionally communicate by these movements.	According to Professor Vallortiara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.	According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally interact through these movements.	Nach Ansicht von Professor Vallortigara kommunizieren die Hunde nicht absichtlich miteinander durch diese Bewegungen.
990	He is far more convinced that the dogs acquired experience when they should behave in which way they shouldn't.	He's much more convinced that the dogs learned from experience how to control their own behaviour and when they should not.	He's much more convinced that the dog gained experience in which they should behave and when not.	Er ist vielmehr überzeugt, dass die Hunde aus Erfahrung gelernt hätten, bei welchen Bewegungen sie sich Sorgen machen sollten und wann nicht.
991	"If you've had a lot of behavior with other dogs and the barking gets going in a kind direction, and the right side tends to behave less friendlyly, then you react on the basis of those experiences."""	If you have had different beginnings with other dogs and the dogs are started in a positive way, and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then react on the basis of those experiences.	When you have different behaviours with other dogs and behaved wisely, the wise will respond in response on the basis of experience.	"Er sagte: „Wenn man verschiedene Begegnungen mit anderen Hunden hat und das Wedeln mit dem Schwanz in eine Richtung eher mit freundlichem Verhalten verknüpft ist und die rechte Seite eher ein weniger freundliches Verhalten produziert, dann reagiert man auf Basis dieser Erfahrungen."""
992	The forschers say that the findings of trainers, dogs and trainers could help them to get a better understanding of their animals' emotions.	The forgers say that the knowledge gained from owners, zoos and trainers can help give dogs a better understanding of their pets' emotions.	The forefathers say that the knowledge of dogstains, vets and trainers could help improve their understanding of animals' emotions.	Die Forscher sagen, dass die Erkenntnisse Hundebesitzern, Tierärzten und Trainern zu einem besseren Verständnis der Emotionen ihres Tieres verhelfen könnten.

John Bradshaw, Experte für Hundeverhalten und Gaststipendiat an der Fakultät für Tierheilkunde der Universität von Bristol erklärte, dies sei nicht die erste Studie gewesen, bei der untersucht wurde, ob links und rechts für Hunde wichtig sei.
994	Last year a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn back to right when they look at an aggressive dog, and then towards the right when they are looking at a pleased dog.	Last year a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs can turn their heads when they look at an aggressive dog, and towards the left when they look at a contented dog.	A team at the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads when they look at an aggressive dog and right when they look at a happy dog.	Letztes Jahr fand ein Team der Universität von Lincoln heraus, dass Hunde den Kopf nach links drehen, wenn sie einen aggressiven Hund ansehen, und nach rechts, wenn es sich um einen zufriedenen Hund handelt.
995	In another research project at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following is said: Hundreds go to a robot when their weak links aren't straight and aren't being rubbed against each other — precisely unlike the Italian study.	In a research paper at the Victoria University in Canada, the following is taken from a robot's home where its weak links are blurred and not right, instead of being unrusive – just as it is in the Italian study.	A paper done at the University of Victoria in Canada said that half a robot is safer when its links are not straight and therefore become unreliable – quite apart from the Italian one.	"In einer anderen Forschungsarbeit an der Universität von Victoria in Kanada stand Folgendes: „Hunde gehen eher auf einen Roboterhund zu, wenn sein ,Schwanz‘ links wedelt und nicht rechts, statt unruhig zu werden – genau andersherum als in der italienischen Studie."""
996	According to his statement, the differences between the different studies in which the dogs are interviewed as animals in the films and the robots aren't interpretable as dogs.	According to his statement, the differences between the animal films and robots may not be significant.	Apparently, his statement makes it clear that the dogs seen in different studies are not interpretable as dog's.	Laut seiner Aussage könnten die Unterschiede daher rühren, dass die Hunde in den verschiedenen Studien die Tiere in den Filmen bzw. die Roboterhunde nicht als Hunde interpretierten.
997	A study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.	A research on how dogs react to real dogs may help, he explained.	A study on how dogs react to real dogs could help, explained he.	Eine Studie, wie Hunde auf echte Hunde reagieren, könnte helfen, erklärte er.
998	"While there's plenty of evidence for many different mammals that have brain parts used for different purposes, many details still need to be taken into account – and dogs don't make exceptions,"" says Bradshaw."	"Although there's some reasonable belief among many different mammals that both haplotypes are being used for different purposes, many details have still to be considered, and dogs aren't the exception"", Bradshaw added."	"Although there's a good chance for many different organisms to use the brainstem for different purposes, many details still need to be taken into account – and dogs make no exception of that"", says Bradshaw."	"„Zwar gibt es beträchtliche Belege für viele verschiedene Säugetiere, dass die beiden Gehirnhälften für verschiedene Zwecke verwendet werden, doch müssen viele der Details noch bestimmt werden – und Hunde bilden da keine Ausnahme"", so Bradshaw."
999	Since her behaviour is left simple, it shouldn't take long for us to understand that the tension sometimes swings in one direction and sometimes in the other direction.	As her behaviour is but subtle, it won't probably take long before we realize why the tension sometimes moves in one direction, or sometimes in the other direction.	Since her behavior is so simple, it won't likely take long before we get used to it; for instance, when the struggle goes towards one, sometimes it goes further.	Da sich ihr Verhalten aber einfach aufzeichnen lasse, werde es vermutlich nicht lange dauern, bis wir verstehen, weshalb sich der Schwanz manchmal in die eine, manchmal in die andere Richtung bewegt.

Having come back in June 2007, after a decade when he was prime minister, Blair dominated the debate on foreign policy and his role as peacemaker in the Nazeast.

1153	Even in the rental house, let's make a decision, and when it only applies to the bathroom renovation, the architect takes notice of that.

1156	There could be a lift installed inside the flat which, like those stairs, would provide a much wider way up to the apartment door but was considerably larger than it would be.	Rather than installing a lift within the flat, the way up to the flat entrance would have been much larger.	There might be a lift within the flat that would also provide a staircase up to the attic but would be much larger than that.	Zwar könnte man innerhalb der Wohnung einen Treppenlift installieren, der ebenfalls mit Treppen gepflasterte Weg bis an die Wohnungstür wäre aber das weitaus größere Hindernis.

1158	Before she moved, she groaned more than her apartment door shut before she blew open.	Before she moved, she groaned more than her apartment door.	Before shifting, she groaned more than before she'd put on her flat door.	Vor dem Umzug graut es ihr mehr als vor der Spinne an ihrer Wohnungstür.

1210	The fragile relationship is not the mere act of a drug dealer but the practice of sex trading which supplies drugs to his lawyer.	The fragile relationship is not simply one of drug dealers, but one of drug dealers who provide his lawyer with drugs.

His lack of self-confidence led to a hopeless compromise, and making him increasingly relevant to the organized criminal organisation which recruited him to collect valuable information on police activities.	Seine Kokainabhängigkeit führte zu einer hoffnungslosen Kompromittierung und machte ihn empfänglich für die Motive führender Mitglieder der organisierten Kriminalität, die ihn beauftragten, wertvolle Informationen über polizeiliche Ermittlungen einzuholen.

"Would you like to make the track ""Am Stubble"" open in order to increase safety?"	"Soll der Bahnübergang ""Am Hirschen"" aufwändig umgebaut werden, um die Verkehrssicherheit zu erhöhen?"
1246	Yes, the councillors have closed.	Yes, the councillors joined in.	Yes, we've set the councillors.	Ja, haben die Gemeinderäte beschlossen.
1247	You'll have to take care of it by putting in 220 000 euros.	For a glass of wine, there's got to be 220 000 euros.	If you want to take it easy, you'll need to take it out by 210 000 euros.	Schiltach muss dafür 220 000 Euro in die Hand nehmen.
1248	The German Railway intends to improve the Kinyza Railway Line in the coming year.	The German Railways are planning to improve the Kinzal railway line next year.	The German Railway will improve the Kininga railway line in the future.	Die Deutsche Bahn will im kommenden Jahr die Kinzigtal-Bahnstrecke verbessern.
1249	Particularly, the safety of the railways should be increased: it happens frequently when trains collide with other vehicles.	In particular there should be increased security on rail platforms - often it happens that trains collide with other cars nationwide.	The safety on the railways is being increased in particular; regular collisions between trains and other vehicles happen nationwide.	Besonders soll dabei die Sicherheit an Bahnübergängen erhöht werden - regelmäßig kommt es bundesweit zu Kollisionen von Zügen mit anderen Fahrzeuge.
1250	If the council wants to take on the construction work, they have to split their costs by a third and the rest split railways and rails.	To help fund the construction work, the councils must share one third of costs; the rest divides the railways and the road.	If you want to support the construction work, they need to contribute 1/3rd to the costs; the rest divides railways and bridges.	Stimmen die Gemeinden den Umbaumaßnahmen zu, müssen sie sich mit einem Drittel an den Kosten beteiligen, den Rest teilen sich Bahn und Bund.
1251	"Local councillor Roland Grinstead explained the specialties of the bahoon ""at the top of the hill""."	"Architectural firm Roland Grießhaber explained to the councillor the peculiarities of the bay area known as ""The stag""."	Architectural firm Roland Grapphaber taught the council how to deal with the area's poor and elderly.	"Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber erläuterte dem Gemeinderat die Besonderheiten des Bahübergangs ""Am Hirschen""."
1252	There the city is building a railway station, in the top of these tunnels westwards of the railway line.	There, the town build a bridge on the east side of the underground tunnel in order to access the railway line.	There are planning to construct the city by building an outcropping along the railway line in the vicinity of the underground tunnels running to the west of the railway.	Dort plant die Stadt, in Höhe des dortigen Tunnelmundes westlich der Bahngleise eine Ausbuchtung zu bauen.
1253	They could also accommodate larger vehicles like that are transporting lumber such as when there's an influx of traffic without having to block the roads.	Then, too, could there be larger vehicles, such as those that transport long pieces - standing in the way of traffic, without having to block the road.	There could be bigger vehicles such as those transporting heavy equipment, on the other side of the road, standing in opposition to the traffic without having to block the roads.	Dort könnten auch größere Fahrzeuge, zum Beispiel solche, die Langholz transportieren, bei Gegenverkehr stehen, ohne die Gleise blockieren zu müssen.
1254	It is therefore advisable for builders to design a necessary ramp so that the town can divert the traffic on the subsequent road in order to ensure a relatively smooth flow of traffic.	Architects would like to design a necessary bridge to ensure cities can cross the street and in turn, make it a smoother road for visitors.	In consequence, planners should consider using a necessary bridge to ensure that the streets connecting the city can take longer so that they can be used for a reliable traffic flow in order to ensure a safe transport.	Grießhaber schlug daher vor, eine erforderliche Stützmauer so zu konstruieren, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße zu gegebener Zeit verbreitern könne, um einen reibungslosen Verkehrsfluss zu gewährleisten.
1255	It was debated in town council, at some point the question of whether a road traffic safety issue might arise. Thomas Kipp elevated the sentiment of the critic, saying: Should we have to spend so little money on such unkute vehicles?	This was a debate among the councillors because some expressed concerns about the possibility of a traffic ban. Thomas Kipp brought up the point that critics were questioning whether we should take such a large sum of money?	It was debated at the council meeting, when some people raised the possibility of a traffic ban: Thomas Kipp brought the criticism on the point that critics suggested we should take so little money in order to prevent trafficking.	"Dies wurde im Gemeinderat kontrovers diskutiert, da einige Räte die Notwendigkeit einer Straßenverbreitung in Zweifel zogen: Thomas Kipp brachte mit seiner Äußerung die Stimmung der Kritiker auf den Punkt: ""Müssen wir wegen so wenigen Fahrzeugen so viel Geld in die Hand nehmen?"""
1256	Mayor Tom Haas said that the rail interchanges are regularly used for transporting wood.	Mayor Tom Haas confirmed that underground tracks are often used for lung-tooth transport.	Tom Haas told us that the railway tracks are frequently used for light rail traffic.	"Bürgermeister Thomas Haas widersprach: Der Bahnübergang ""Hirschen"" werde regelmäßig für Langholztransporte genutzt."
1257	"Even lumber from the section ""Kuhbach"" will be used to transport this line, because the 20 metre long vehicles that could reach the harbour bridge can't use it due to the possibility of joining the main road there."	Even wood from the section Kuhbach can be transported across that stretch, because vehicles up to 20 m long could not use the crossing via the harbour bridge because they couldn't access it through the main street.	Even wood from the area Kuhbach will be used on this stretch, because the 20 metre long vehicles could not use the bridge as it would not be accessible via the main road.	"Selbst Holz aus dem Bereich ""Kuhbach"" werde teilweise über diese Strecke transportiert, weil die bis zu 20 Meter langen Fahrzeuge die Strecke an der Häberlesbrücke nicht nutzen könnten, weil sie dort nicht in die Hauptstraße abbiegen könnten."
1258	Further to that, the track can be used as a roundabout for those vehicles which cannot use the tunnel when it's busy the main road, argumentative Haa.	Further along the road, the section of the track is used as a roundabout for those vehicles that can't use the tunnel if it's blocked by the highway, argumentative Haas.	Further to the left, the route is construed as a means of interconnection for those vehicles which cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed, arguments argue.	Darüber hinaus diene die Strecke als Umleitungfür diejenigen Fahrzeuge, die den Tunnel nicht benutzen dürfen, wenn die Hauptstraße gesperrt ist, argumentierte Haas.
1259	"Since it's too late to replace the trams built and erected in Turin as they are now in Wolfsburg, it's possible to bring the railway line ""Across the Rhine"" for a longer period to use as a major transport link."	"Since it's becoming apparent that the construction of tunnels and bridges – like they do in Wolfsburg right now – need to be scrapped and cleaned up, the railway line ""At the fort"", therefore, could potentially hold its important rail connection for longer."	"Given that construction and renovation of crumbling bridges like those currently occupy Wolfsburg, the ""railway"" could potentially become a significant traffic corridor for a longer period as well."	"Da abzusehen sei, dass Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnel umgebaut und saniert werden müssten, wie dies derzeit in Wolfach der Fall ist, könne dem Bahnübergang ""Am ""Hirschen"" auch für einen längeren Zeitraum eine wichtige Verkehrsbedeutung zukommen."
1260	The debate began to over the cost of the planned widening of the street.	The people came forward to see whether any damage was going to be caused by the planned closure of the street.	The plan was to have a meeting with the council on how to avoid having to incur the cost of the proposed widening of the road.	Die Räte kamen überein, untersuchen zu lassen, welche Kosten die angedachte Verbreiterung der Straße verursachen würde.
1261	Considering the fact that the extension of the rail tracks was in full swing, with the intent of building the necessary walkways to allow the city to bridge the adjacent railway lines on round five metres.	"Considering the fact that the tram's length was widened by the requirement that the necessary bridges are constructed so as to make the city's then-straight line ""station road"" accessible from about 5,5 meters."	"In spite of the fact that the reopening of the railway station was put on hold by the requirement that the necessary bridges are constructed so as to make the city's main thoroughfares into the ""Travel Station"" at around 5,5 metres apiece."	"Ungeachtet dessen wurde dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs mehrheitlich zugestimmt mit der Maßgabe, dass die erforderliche Stützmauer so gebaut wird, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße Richtung ""Bahnhofstraße"" gegebenenfalls für Begegnungsverkehr auf rund 5,5 Meter ausbauen könne."
1262	"The closure of the railways at the Railway station could pose a whole other problem that arises when it concerns the travel along the highly climbed ""Glasdas""."	"During the construction of the railway tracks in the Gerber Trautwein might pose a whole other problem, which is connected with the passage into the steep ""Gerolt-Boulevard"""	Besides the construction of the track at the railway station, there might be quite another problem that arises when you cross the steep hills to the north.	"Der Umbau des Bahnübergangs bei der Gerberei Trautwein könnte dagegen ein ganz anderes Problem nach sich ziehen, das die Zufahrt in den stark ansteigenden ""Geroltzhäuser Weg"" betrifft."
1263	The planning department of the railway had been looking at the plans for the station's redevelopment, having doubted whether the planned connection to the railway line would be possible or not.	The management had been looking at the scheme for the railway from the engineering firm Breinlinger, having doubts whether the planned line would be extended to other pens should it be possible.	The authority had considered the plans for the tram layout from the engineering firm Breinlinger, having doubts whether it would be possible to carry on the planned route through the lava fields.	Die Verwaltung hatte die Umbaupläne der Bahn vom Ingenieurbüro Breinlinger untersuchen lassen, da sie Zweifel daran hatte, ob der geplante Anschluss des Geroltzhäuser Wegs dann noch ohne weiteres möglich sei.
1264	It's concluded from the investigation that it's not too likely to be argued that traffic circumstances might lead to longer vehicles being driven.	The study found that it was not enough to conclude that the road's contour may prevent longer cars from stumbling.	The report came to the conclusion that it wasn't enough to conclude that the traffic conditions in the road might make longer cars sit.	Die Untersuchung kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass nicht auszuschließen sei, dass die Neigungsverhältnisse der Straße dazu führen könnten, dass längere Fahrzeuge aufsitzen.
1265	The responsibility for this again is on the city's side as a road bridge.	This makes the city a more dangerous traffic hub.	Here's why the town's become a traffic-fighting organisation.	Die Verantwortung hierfür trage wiederum die Stadt als Straßenbaulastträgerin.
1266	In addition, the builder may sue for damages.	That build might prove to be entitled to claim damages afterward.	The builder can dispute disputes over whether there's any liability.	Der Umbau könne demnach Haftungsstreitigkeiten nach sich ziehen.
1267	Because both the beam and the ties were already in use, the bridges should not be extended to allow for the construction of the platform, said Haa.	Both the carriages and the platform being in order to keep up with the pace of modern construction, argumentated Haa.	Because both the carriages and the platforms were in the present state of being, construction work at the railway station was not supposed to be carried out, argued Haa.	Da sowohl die Holzabfuhr als auch das Abbiegen im aktuellen Ausbauzustand funktionierten, solle man dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs nicht zustimmen, argumentierte Haas.
1268	At this place, the risk of a collision between a vehicle on the way across a train is much lower than that of other rail crossings, as it is just about to the point in front of the terminus and providing good view.	The odds of a collision on a railway line with a vehicle on the way over are very less than those for other trains because it is located just opposite the station center, which makes good visibility.	A collision on the track with a vehicle approaching from the other side is much less likely than a collision on the railway line because it's just opposite the junction to the right of the railway line and in close proximity to the bus station, giving good visibility.	Auch sei an dieser Stelle das Risiko einer Kollision des Zuges mit einem auf dem Übergang stehenden Fahrzeug deutlich geringer als an den anderen Bahnübergängen, weil sich direkt daneben der Haltepunkt Mitte befinde, zu dem eine gute Sichtverbindung bestehe.
1269	Even swarms of the city centre have already been bremished in this spot so that there is no collision.	Even swarms of workers on this site should have already been trimmed so they won't cause any collision.	Even the nearest station should have already been designed so that there isn't a collision.	Selbst Züge vom Hauptbahnhof her müssten an dieser Stelle schon soweit abgebremst sein, dass keine Kollision drohe.
1270	The majority of the city approved the construction of this railway, since the city had to deal with the problem of sitting cars so that the railway could be put back into its responsibility after having finished the work.	"By majority vote this railway crossroad was withdrawn, as the city drew the problem with the carriages on site ""uttoring"", meaning the track would be freed from responsibility after the completion of the work."	In favour of reopening this railway, the city council put an extra ban on parking for cars on standby, so the railway was to be reopened after the construction work.	"Mehrheitlich wurde dem Umbau dieses Bahnübergangs die Zustimmung verweigert, da die Stadt Schiltach das Problem mit aufsitzenden Fahrzeugen ""ausbaden müsste"", so die Räte, da sich die Bahn nach Abschluss der Bauarbeiten aus der Verantwortung zurückziehen könne."
1271	"When it comes to the economics, the crossings between the tracks ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Kuhbach"" were made for the first time by railway tracks linking the rail tracks."	Nevertheless, the Great Depression erupted on the railway tracks between Varna and Brahms, as well as the already cross-urban railway tracks crossed.	"If the situation is difficult, the carriages ""Vor Heubach and Van Huck"" were built on the railway tracks for the interchanges between the railway tracks had already occurred."	"Als unproblematisch betrachtet das Gremium die Umbauten an den Bahnübergängen ""Vor Heubach"" und ""Vor Kuhbach"", für die bereits Kreuzungsvereinbarungen mit der Bahn getroffen wurden."

1287	Seeing as the airport manager Peter Kleemann was approaching Radio Vienna, the airport has kept track of the passages people encountering each other, a trend that is international.	Just as airport manager Peter Kleemann spied on Radio Vienna, the airport was setting up checks to track the appearance of people in the individual individuals, a trend international.	The airport was first visited by Peter Kleemann, and the airport's security staff follow the way in which individual people interact with each other, a trend that has spread across the world.	Wie Airport-Sprecher Peter Kleemann gegenüber Radio Wien bekannt gab, folgt der Flughafen Wien mit der Einstellung von Durchsagen, die einzelne Personen betreffen, einem internationalen Trend.
1288	Consequently, airlines like Kopenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already give up their low-cost flights.	By that we've already given up on the noise of the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai.	By and large, the airliners in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already avoid the roaring noise.	So verzichten bereits unter anderem die Flughäfen in Kopenhagen, Frankfurt oder Dubai auf die lärmenden Aufrufe.
1289	As soon as these roads become closed, they usually carry around 200 individual calls per day through the loudspeaker, leaving the airport more calm than before.	Through this passage, which averages around 200 personal telephone calls a day through the loudspeaker's, it will become safer at the airport in the future.	Having run down this traffic - usually, in a day, around 200 personal calls are received by the loudspeakers - it will become less quiet at airport for the future.	Durch den Wegfall dieser Durchsagen - im Durchschnitt ertönen an einem Tag rund 200 persönliche Aufrufe durch die Lautsprecher - soll es künftig ruhiger am Flughafen zugehen.
1290	Even in experience, this particular incident was sadly not worth making but all the other information on changes to flight times or departure times changed slightly, Kleemann told the radiosender.

Wir hatten wirklich Spaß daran, den Defender Challenge-Wagen zu entwickeln – das wird eine unterhaltsame Meisterschaft.
1657	Aside from that, the Defender Challenge has a training and testing day in February, as well as an option to take part in the Wounded Frog in Northern Africa and the Near East.	In addition, in the Defender Challenge there is a training and test session in February as well as the option to take part in the race against the wall in North Africa and East Asia.	In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and testing day in February and there's another option to take part in the World Race in Northern Africa and the Pacific Coast.	Darüber hinaus gibt es bei der Defender Challenge einen Trainings- und Testtag im Februar sowie die Option, an Wüstenrennen in Nordafrika und dem Nahen Osten teilzunehmen.
1658	George Kerevan: Europe is giving the Schottons the choice.	George Kerevan: Union affair gives Schottons the vote.	George Kerevan: European Parliament gives the Schotten the election.	George Kerevan: Europäische Entflechtung gibt den Schotten die Wahl
1659	A new day, a new story of dissolution.	There's a new day, a new story of untold independence.	A new day, a new story of independence.	Ein neuer Tag, eine neue Schreckensgeschichte zur Unabhängigkeit.
1660	This time we will warn that a separate Scotland is required to join the EU as a candidate for the 2020 Olympic Games.	We are warned that an independent Scotland is required to enter the Union by the Treaty of Versailles.	We'll be warning that it's necessary for an independent Scotland to join the EU in order to enter the Schengen Treaty.	Diesmal werden wir gewarnt, dass ein unabhängiges Schottland erforderlich sei, um dem Schengen-Raum als Bedingung für die EU-Mitgliedschaft beizutreten.
1661	This is the epithet for stories of crossings between Berwick and Hadrian's Wall across a strip of steep.	This is the definitive answer for stories of crossings between Berwick and Hadrian's Walls with a steeply fenced boundary.	This is a key word for history of crossing the Rhine River across Berwick, and a sturdy border along the Hadrian Wall.	Das liefert das Stichwort für Geschichten über Passkontrollen in Berwick und eine mit Stacheldraht gesicherte Grenze entlang des Hadrianswalls.
1662	In fact, the debate over the economic benefits of allowing more freedom of travel in Europe was mainly about the way it was perceived, but this wasn't to be used to put into play in the headlines.	Although the Strathclyde argued that there could be more economic benefits for travelers who leave Europe by way of visas, these were not taken into account in the negotiations on Brexit.	Certainly the economic benefits of free travel in restricted Europe were mentioned in the resolution on the subject of Brexit but the prospect of that would not be considered in the debate.	In der Tat wurde in der Strathclyde-Vorlage auf die möglichen wirtschaftlichen Vorteile hingewiesen, die mehr Reisefreiheit im restlichen Europa mit sich bringen würde, doch spielte dies – erwartungsgemäß – in den Schlagzeilen keine Rolle.
1663	Even nobody mentioned that EU-members often adopt strict rules when it's cheaper for them.	Even no one mentioned that the EU-member states often adopt strict rules when it is cheaper for them.	No one either mentioned in the past that EU-member states often adopt strict rules when they're cheaper.	Auch hat niemand erwähnt, dass sich die EU-Mitgliedsstaaten häufig ihre strikten Regeln zurechtbiegen, wenn es für sie günstiger ist.
1664	While Scotland is not in the Schengen Round, the proposed ban on construction for Brussels would just be a modest increase in the amount of money it actually can get from the settlement.	Slovak not in the European Parliament at the moment, the proposed ban on construction of Brussels would be an easing measure by just a small change from the real thing.	Since Scotland isn't currently in the Schengen Convention, the foresaid ban on construction in Belgium would only add a slight weight to the overall plan of action for the city, but it would be enough to make it possible for the city to stand up more than ever before.	Da Schottland derzeit nicht zum Schengen-Raum gehört, wäre die fortgesetzte Nichtbeachtung für Brüssel nur ein kleines Zugeständnis im Gegenzug für das, was man wirklich von den Schotten will.
1665	Not a story at all.	No story at all.	No story at all.	Also eigentlich keine Story.
1666	"And one who has come so far in years that she is already a fossil: the first time I heard ""United means Passport Control."" for at least 40 years."	"And one who has come so far in the years that it is almost as likely that she already owns a fossil: the first time I heard the phrase ""Undependence means passport control"" spoken of at least 40."	And one, who have come so far in the years that they already look like a fossil. This is the first time I heard about the UN Convention on Passports for at least 40 years.	"Und eine, die schon so in der Jahre gekommen ist, dass sie bereits einem Fossil gleicht: Das erste Mal habe ich die „Unabhängigkeit bedeutet Passkontrollen""-Ente vor mindestens 40 Jahren gehört."
1667	This is a significant point when returning to this lost history.	That's a very interesting question when you remember this dull story.	There is a valuable point when trying to revive that lost story.	Dabei geht ein interessanter Punkt beim ständigen Wiederholen dieser uralten Geschichte verloren.
1668	Why should one expect from an independent Scotland that it will follow the European pipe?	Why shouldn't a nation in Scotland expect that it will look like the European peach?	Why should you expect an independent Scotland to have a peach like the European peach?	Weshalb sollte man von einem unabhängigen Schottland erwarten, dass es nach der europäischen Pfeife tanzt?
1669	Why is Britain's Joch against Brussels, especially now?	Why does the Londoner Joch favour the Brussels crowd now, especially now?	Why's the Londoner Joch in favor of Brussels, especially now?	Warum das Londoner Joch gegen das von Brüssel eintauschen, besonders jetzt?
1670	Those are the really new realities in Europe: the large, reformed plan to unite Europe after war is in the stock.	These are the real European news: The large and enduring plan of Union of Europe was ratified in the wake of the war.	These are real European news: the great plan for a union of Europe, formulated after war, has been thrown into the dust.	Das sind die wirklichen europäischen Neuigkeiten: Der große, nach dem Krieg gefasste Plan zur Vereinigung Europas ist ins Stocken geraten.
1671	At the Eurovision, the project Europe officially ended.	The project EU has officially ended.	The project Europa officially ended with the Eurocorps.	Mit der Eurokrise ist das Projekt Europa offiziell gestorben.
1672	In Europe, the UK's political parties win elections on ground to determine who the EU is ultimately or whether the European Union should vote against it.	All in the EU, parties win over ground that want to be a part of the EU but are reluctant to join the Union.	All in the EU, some parties win for ground on the basis that they want to be in the EU or the Union's financial backing to travel.	Überall in der EU gewinnen Parteien an Boden, die EU-feindlich sind oder den Euro als Gemeinschaftswährung über Bord werfen möchten.
1673	Even in Germany, the eurosceptic party alternative for Germany was only founded this year – barely five million votes in the elections to the House of Lords in September, effectively driving out the Liberal Democrats (also parliamentary opposition) from parliament.	Even in Germany the eurosceptical party alternative for Germany – established just this year – gained just five million votes in the election of the Bundestags in September, effectively driving out the free democracies (the equivalent of the Liberal Democrats in the UK) from the parliament.	Even in Germany, the left-wing party Alternative for Germany – founded just this year – barely five million votes cast for themselves in the general election in September, effectively backing the liberal Democrats (who are roughly the size of the British Liberal Democrats) from the parliament.	Selbst in Deutschland konnte die euroskeptische Partei Alternative für Deutschland – erst dieses Jahr gegründet – knapp fünf Millionen Stimmen bei der Bundestagswahl im September für sich ergattern und damit effektiv die Freien Demokraten (das Äquivalent zu den britischen Liberal Democrats) aus dem Bundestag vertreiben.
1674	There has always been a secret resistance against the plan to create a socialist Europe.	There's always a secret resistance against the plan to create a federalist Europe.	There's still a secret resistance against the plan to create a democratic Europe.	Es gab schon immer heimischen Widerstand gegen den Plan, ein föderalistisches Europa zu schaffen.
1675	The current economic situation looks at a turning point.	The current economic climate appears to be a point of departure.	The current economic situation is however a major concern.	Die aktuelle Wirtschaftskrise stellt sich allerdings als Wendepunkt heraus.
1676	In a relationship between Berlin and the European Central Bank, where the national budget is decided upon during the negotiations on the WTO, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.	Due to the strengthening of Spartan Europe and the strengthening of the economic relationship between the Währungszones which will affect each nation economically through the Festhalten, there are many people who believe that the project Europe is too far.	Due to the stark relationship between Berlin and the European Central Bank (SEC), in conjunction with the monetary policy which affects the national economy of each country by the election, many people think that the project Europe has gone too far.	Wegen der von Berlin und der Europäischen Zentralbank verhängten strengen Sparpolitik in Verbindung mit der Zwangsjacke, in die die jeweilige nationale Wirtschaft durch das Festhalten an der gemeinsamen Währung genötigt wird, sind viele Menschen der Ansicht, das Projekt Europa sei zu weit gegangen.
1677	The crisis of the euro had little to do with national governments encouraging excessive budget cuts – only in Greece was that case.	The problem with the Euro is that government cuts on spending when it was only Greece where this happened.	The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governors having to spend money on unnecessary spending – this was only Greece's case.	Die Krise des Euro hat wenig damit zu tun, dass nationale Regierungen exzessive Haushaltsdefizite verursachen – das war nur in Griechenland der Fall.
1678	Stats show that the Eurosystem has fixed interest rates for its members which are particularly attractive to German exporters, and that is what German politicians want to see happen.	Statistically, the Eurozone has ratified its members' swaps which are particularly beneficial to German exporters and would like to allow them to do so by German politicians.	Statistically, the Eurosystem has notified its members of exchange rates that are generally favorable to German exporters – and they want to let German politicians do that.	Stattdessen hat das Eurosystem seine Mitglieder auf Wechselkurse festgenagelt, die für deutsche Exporteure vorteilhaft sind – und das möchten deutsche Politiker gern so lassen.
1679	Without the possibility of a price reduction of the local currency, South Europe is again facing a productivity slump.	Without the possibility of a regional currency devaluation, South Europe has an attractive productivity share with Germany.	Without the possibility of a price drop for the local currency, Southern Europe has a higher-quality production share than Germany.	Ohne die Möglichkeit einer Abwertung der lokalen Währung findet sich Südeuropa mit einem eingebauten Produktivitätsnachteil gegenüber Deutschland wieder.
1680	All it takes is to reduce budgets and cuts in public expenditures – mostly from Berlin.	The only way to cut back on the labor and public expenditures is by importing money from Berlin.	The only way you can cut back on labor and spending is to avert the spread of Berlin.	Die einzige Möglichkeit besteht darin, Löhne und öffentliche Ausgaben zu kürzen – angespornt von Berlin.
1681	There is a deep-seated problem of the current state of the economy in Europe.	Behind the current state of employment and wage problems lies a deepening problem for European productivity.	Under the current crisis in employment and wages is a deep problem in European productivity.	Hinter den aktuellen Etat- und Währungsproblemen liegt ein tiefer gehendes europäisches Produktivitätsproblem.
1682	When the BRUSSELS' green energy policies – a code to subsidise French and German electric companies on behalf of the consumers – are adopted, the European industry is paying for the double in electricity and the four times for gas.	When the ordinances adopting “green” energy standards, which protect the franco-franken and German energie companies on behalf of the consumer, cost the European Industry the double for electricity and the four times for gas.	By adopting the Green Energy Councils (a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer) the European Union doubled its electricity consumption to the United States and fourfolded its gas consumption.	"Als Folge der von Brüssel verordneten „grünen"" Energierichtlinien – ein Code für die Subventionierung französischer und deutscher Energieunternehmen auf Kosten der Verbraucher – zahlt die europäische Industrie verglichen mit den Vereinigten Staaten das Doppelte für Elektrizität und das Vierfache für Gas."
1683	It's a relatively low cost, as we saw in Gatemouth.	This is a lower-cost alternative to what we could have seen in Gatemouth.	It's not a high-cost item like what we saw in Grangemouth already.	Das ist ein lähmender Kostennachteil, wie wir bereits in Grangemouth sehen konnten.
1684	All the scuttles in the world warn of the dangers of cheap American coals being used to mine.	Every league in the world wants to protect the euro-based chemical industry from being sacked by billions of American electricity.	World leaders don't prevent Europe's petrochemical industry from being threatened by cheap US gas in the corners.	Alle Lohnfestschreibungen der Welt schützen die europäische petrochemische Industrie nicht davor, von billigem amerikanischem Schiefergas in die Ecke gedrängt zu werden.
1685	In response to that, a revolt is taking place, particularly in France, which is the undisputed leader of the EU.	A revolt is in the coming as a result, particularly in France, the undisputed leader of the EU.	In response, a revolution is taking hold, especially in France that is the undisputed leader of the EU.	Als Folge zieht eine Revolte herauf, besonders in Frankreich, dem einstigen Cheerleader der EU.
1686	After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a vehicle for transport where Germany held a schism and Washington could raise it from its summit.	France's political elite saw the EU as a bridge between Germany and Washington, while Washington was able to reach the top.	After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany was holding a match and Washington could climb the summit.	Nach dem Krieg sah die politische Elite Frankreichs die EU als ein Vehikel, mit dem man Deutschland in Schach halten und Paris auf Augenhöhe mit Washington heben konnte.
1687	However, Paris doesn't need Paris more than a political mandate, and has developed his own economic policy which fought the collapse of the French economy.	But Paris doesn't need Paris more than a backdrop for political legitimacy and has defined its own economic policy against the collapse of France's economy.	But Paris no longer requires Paris as a political instrument, and Europa has put its own economic policy into battle against the collapsed French economy.	Doch Berlin braucht Paris nicht mehr als Tor zur politischen Legitimation und hat Europa seine eigene Wirtschaftspolitik aufgedrückt, womit die angeschlagene französische Wirtschaft zu kämpfen hat.
1688	The result: Marine Le Pen, justice-court ruling, has just won a decisive election and with it, the ruling socialists have taken place on number three.	The result: In appeal to the supreme court, the EU-backed Front National won an election decisive, leaving the ruling socialists on the third row.	The outcome: In a ruling court of appeal, the European Front National has won an electoral election and placed the former socialists on the fourth spot.	Das Ergebnis: Marine Le Pens rechtsgerichteter, EU-feindlicher Front National hat gerade eine entscheidende Nachwahl gewonnen und damit die regierenden Sozialisten auf Platz drei verwiesen.
1689	The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the UK Labour Party that they can't afford to lose their temper because a split in the right direction would bring benefits to the linky parties.	The Front National is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes – a momentary warning for the British Labour Party that it can't afford to vote on a split in the right direction.	Front-Nation is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote; a moment's warning for the British Labour Party that they can't take into account if there were any differences between the right and the left.	Der Front National ist nun die beliebteste Partei in Frankreich mit 24 Prozent der Wählerstimmen – eine zeitgerechte Warnung für die britische Labour-Partei, dass sie nicht davon ausgehen kann, eine Spaltung im rechten Spektrum würde automatisch Vorteile für die Linke bedeuten.
1690	What makes Le Pen so popular among white French workers?	What makes Le Pen so popular after her recent gain in popularity among the white French working class?	What is Léo Pen's newly gained Popularity among the white French workers?	Was macht Le Pen mit ihrer neu gewonnen Popularität unter den weißen Franzosen der Arbeiterklasse?
1691	She wants to use the EU referendum next year to invoke an anti-EU and anti-democracy ban in the European Parliament.	She wants to use the EU ballot next year to urge the adoption of a bill calling for ban on EU funding and anti-Gem violence within the European Parliament.	She wants to use the EU election next year to push for an EU-wide vote.	Sie möchte die EU-Wahlen nächstes Jahr dazu nutzen, einen Anti-EU-, Anti-Gemeinschaftswährungsblock im Europäischen Parlament zu schmieden.
1692	If the anti-EU parties win these elections – and that's very well possible – then there might be a block like parliament in the future.	If the anti-EU parties vote in these elections – and it's very likely – then there may first be a block that dominates the European Parliament.	If the anti-EU parties turn out well in these elections – and this is very likely – then they could be dominating the European Parliament for the first time.	Falls die Anti-EU-Parteien bei diesen Wahlen gut abschneiden – und das ist sehr gut möglich –, dann könnte erstmals ein solcher Block das Europäische Parlament dominieren.
1693	This is the point that I want to make, as a matter of no future, the growing frustration against the EU and the commonwealth will not bring about the withdrawal of the euro.	This is the point from which I want to take off: In not a very long future will the growing resistance against the EU and the collective movement towards the abolishing of Europe united against the withdrawal of the euro.	This is the point I want to touch on: In not too distant future, the growing frustration against the EU and the common currency will join forces to defeat the Euro.	Dies ist der Punkt, auf den ich hinaus will: In nicht allzu ferner Zukunft wird das wachsende Ressentiment gegen die EU und die gemeinsame Währung sich zur Abschaffung des Euro zusammenfinden.
1694	"The EU won't wind, but they'll eventually take on the form of the ""European Union"", which the General de Gaulle promoted."	"The EU won't shrink, but she'll get as far as the ""Europe of the (Soviet) Nation"", as the General de Gaulle promoted it."	"The EU is not going to disappear, but it will grow closer and closer to the ""Europa of the (Soudan) Nation"" which the General de Gaulle promoted."	"Die EU wird nicht verschwinden, aber sie wird eher so etwas wie das „Europa der (souveränen) Nationen"" werden, das General de Gaulle favorisierte."
1695	Germany and a few of its satellites may observe the Euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own ways.	Germany and a couple of his satellite networks might be in the mood for the next Euro, but France and south Europa will soon have their own way of doing things.	Germany and a couple of his satellites may make the Euro final, but France and South Europe are going to return their own ways.	Deutschland und ein paar seiner Satelliten-Wirtschaften halten vielleicht am Euro fest, aber Frankreich und Südeuropa werden zu ihren eigenen Währungen zurückkehren.
1696	I expect that the project aims to inspire Britain to come together with the USA.	I anticipate that Britain's participation in this project will lead to hopes of settling with the United States.	I anticipate the project's impact on Britannia in hopes of cementing its place in the United States.	Ich erwarte, dass sich Großbritannien von diesem Projekt distanziert in der Hoffnung, sich bei den USA einzuschmeicheln.
1697	However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be able to survive the rain on its own.	But Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in an Atlantic rain.	However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be able to compete in the coming rain.	Allerdings legt Washingtons wachsendes Interesse am Pazifikraum nahe, dass Großbritannien allein im atlantischen Regen stehen wird.
1698	Where's Scotland when it comes to all of that?	Where's Scotland with all these?	Where's Scotland for all these?	Wo bleibt Schottland bei all dem?
1699	We can decide a region to be of (in the end) small England.	We can decide on being a region of small-scale.	We can determine to be a region of (in the long run) small England.	Wir können entscheiden, eine Region von (in letzter Konsequenz) Klein-England zu sein.
1700	Or we can defend our own economic interests – that is, say they can do to Berlin and Brüssel what they can do to their place.	Or we can defend our own economic interests – what's the matter with Berlin and Brussels, to say what they can do about it.	Or we can defend our own economic interests — so too, say Berlin and Brussels what they have to face.	Oder wir können unsere eigenen wirtschaftlichen Interessen verteidigen – wozu auch gehört, Berlin und Brüssel zu sagen, was sie sich wo hinstecken können.
1701	I think that Scotland could easily find a way to escape a more relaxed European temper, if we keep our own clothes.	I guess that Scotland could potentially make a locker, European Verbund, if we kept our own way.	I think Scotland could quite easily move into a more liberal European Verbund, if we keep our own way of dressing.	Ich vermute, Schottland könnte in einem lockereren europäischen Verbund ganz gut fahren, sofern wir unsere eigene Währung behalten.
1702	Cooperation with other similar thinking countries is easier in a not-favoured European nation.	Cooperation with other similar-minded countries is simpler in a not far away Europe.

Die Kooperation mit anderen, ähnlich denkenden Ländern ist in einem nicht föderierten Europa der Nationen einfacher.
1703	In summary, we should consider it to be a cause for concern and our economic dependence.	Meanwhile, we should consider the situation in Norway and the status of our economic dependence.	In the meantime, we should try to keep it from happening nor that we have economic dependence on one another.	Ansonsten sollten wir erwägen, es Norwegen gleichzutun und unsere wirtschaftliche Unabhängigkeit behalten.
1704	SNP in Scotland is perhaps the most successful political movement against a partition of Europe, winning surprisingly large majority through the withdrawal of the Labour party leadership Alistair Darling and the subsequent Conservatives' Dem coalition.	SNP in Scotland is, amongst other things, Europe's successfulest political movement against the Spartak Party and won a massive majority in 2011, thanks to the withdrawal of the proposed coalition government under the Labour-Lib Dem-Koalition from the Coalition.	In short, the SNP in Scotland is the most successful political movement against Sparta and achieved sanitization of the UK in 2011, with the passage of the Tory-Lib Dem coalition to answer the growing majority of the electorate.	Die SNP-Regierung in Schottland ist – bemerkenswerterweise – die erfolgreichste politische Bewegung gegen die Sparpolitik in Europa und hat 2011 eine spektakuläre Mehrheit aufgrund der Ablehnung der vorgeschlagenen (und vorgenommenen) Kürzungen gewonnen, die der Labour-Finanzminister Alistair Darling und die nachfolgende Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition zu verantworten hatten.
1705	It seems ridiculous for Scotland to choose a undependency now only so as to get out of Berlin and Brussels.	It would be rude for Scotland to decide now for a independence only to get away with Berlin and Brussels in a Sparpolitik.	It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for a self-governing only to get out of Berlin and Brussels.	Es wäre für Schottland lächerlich, sich jetzt für eine Unabhängigkeit zu entscheiden, nur um dann von Berlin und Brüssel eine Sparpolitik aufgezwungen zu bekommen.

Most new planes and other aircraft which were built to aspire to the use of Wi-Fi in higher elevation should meet certain criteria.

"„Es läuft wirklich darauf hinaus, Fluggesellschaften Flexibilität zu geben, damit sie das tun können, was sie ihrer Ansicht nach müssen, um erfolgreich zu sein"", erläutert der Flugkabinenexperte Kent Craver von Boeing."
1878	You don't want us to dictate what they do profitably.	You don't want us to dictate to them what they do profitably.	They don't want that we dictate to them what they make profitable.	Sie möchten nicht, dass wir ihnen diktieren, was sie profitabel macht.
1879	They know their business better than anybody else does.	You know her business better than anyone else does.	You know her business better than anyone else does.	Sie kennen ihr Geschäft besser als jeder andere.
1880	For air passengers, it's about more egg-freeze but for manufacturers it'll become a subject that affects the composition of the contracts in greater measure.	For the airline passengers it's about more safety in landings, but for manufacturers it'll become a subject of debate in and out of the conventions.	For passengers on air, it's about increased skin freedom, but for manufacturers it'll become a subject which can shape the plans in increasingly broad ways.	Für Fluggäste geht es um mehr Ellenbogenfreiheit, aber für Hersteller wird es in zunehmendem Maße ein Thema, das sich auf die Umsätze auswirken kann.
1881	In the next generation of tension, there is a rally of airspaces in which the export price of aircraft could continue to rise to a level of as much as 700 billion US dollar during the next decade, depending on how the market share of the United States or Europe may impact.	In the background of the exchange a series of negotiations about airplanes with a forecast of about 700 billion US dollars over the next few decades to determine whether the export value of the U.S.A. or Europe will continue to decline sharply.	A series of negotiations will put a price increase on aircraft with a forecast of about 700 billion US dollars as a benchmark in the coming decade, which could have an impact on the export market of the USA or Europe.	Hinter der Auseinandersetzung steht ein Rennen um Flugzeugbestellungen mit einem geschätzten Volumen von mindestens 700 Milliarden US-Dollar nach Listenpreisen in den kommenden Jahrzehnten, was sich nachhaltig auf die Exportbilanz der USA oder Europas auswirken könnte.
1882	For the first time since July, the conference layout is the driving force behind the reunification of the new jets.	As first reported by Time magazine in July, the seat plan is the driving force behind the new jets' cross-country flight.	As first reported by The Telegraph in July, the back-up layout is the driving force behind the merger of the new jets.	Wie Reuters im Juli erstmals berichtete, ist das Sitzlayout die treibende Kraft hinter der Auseinandersetzung um die neuen Jets.
1883	Both Airbus and Boeing say they'll be able to achieve 20 percent more efficiency in their new two-turboved long distances than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 747-300ER.	Both Airbus and Boeing say they'll be able to achieve 20 percent more efficiency in their new two-cylinder long-distance rockets than the market leader in this segment, Boeing 77-300ER.	Both Airbus and Boeing say they will see 20 percent longer margins on their new two-motor long-distance generation than the market leader for this segment, Boeing 77-300ER, which operates in 365 seats.	Sowohl Airbus als auch Boeing behaupten 20 Prozent mehr Effizienz pro Sitz bei ihren neuesten zweimotorigen Langstreckendesigns als der Marktführer in diesem Segment, die 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER.
1884	The Boeing's prediction of the results partly reflects that the 777X with its ten seats in a row will be able to compete with the original design of the 737.	The Boeing claims that the 777X with its ten seats in series, will be able to carry on the original design of the 777.	The Boeing's results largely depend on the fact that the 777-700 is going to be better fitted with its ten seats in the original design and will have nine seats in the 767.	Die Aussagen Boeings zu den Ergebnissen hängen teilweise davon ab, dass die 777X mit ihren zehn Sitzen pro Reihe mit dem Originaldesign von neun Sitzen in der 777 verglichen wird.
1885	The cost of living is still lower than the current price of machines with ten seats.	The cost of living by unit is still lower than the current used machine ten seats per row.	The cost of an assembly increase is still lower than the cost of a single seat machine used today, which has ten seats in a row.	Die gestiegenen Kosten pro Einheit sind immer noch geringer als bei derzeit verwendeten Maschinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe.
1886	By far, more seats on his plane are needed so as to make our products competitively cheaper, says Kevin Keniston, head of the passenger compartment at Eurobus.	"By doing that, he is reducing seat in his jet so he can make our products more competitively priced"", says Kevin Keniston, managing director for passengers on board the European Airbus."	"By flying more seats in his plane, we make it cheaper to produce our products by being able to compete with competitors,"" says Kevin Keniston, head of the cabin operations at Europe Airbus."	"„Boeing quetscht deshalb mehr Sitze in sein Flugzeug, um es wettbewerbsfähiger zu unseren Produkten zu machen"", sagt Kevin Keniston, Leiter für Passagierkomfort bei der europäischen Airbus."
1887	A second opinion from analysts who said that full cabins with ten seats on existing 777s claimed they had made many travellers think it would be cheaper to fly in cheaper planes.	Meanwhile, analysts say all the planes on board the current 747 were saying that they thought many passengers would prefer a cheaper flight to more expensive ones.	Meanwhile, analysts believe that all the cabins with ten seats on existing 777s suggested that there were many passengers planning to take advantage of the lower prices offered by cheaper airlines.	Andererseits sagen Analysten, volle Kabinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe bei vorhandenen 777s deuteten darauf hin, dass sich viele Passagiere für die engere Anordnung entschieden, was mit billigeren Flugtarifen einhergehen könnte.
1888	Airbus' fleet comprises eighteen tyres, but the capacity is huge: from a financial point of view, the airline operates the cabin network on the Boeing 787, says Mary Kirby, executive director and founder of Runway Girl Network.	The capacity of seats for passengers on the ground is impressive, however, as Airbus has a competitive advantage from the 777-200, says Mary Kirby, specialist in cabining, founder and executive editor of Runway Girl Network.	A seat width of eighteen is great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic standpoint, Airbus is able to offer the same service that they use in the domestic market, and is the founder of Runway Girl Network.	"„Achtzehn Zoll Sitzbreite wären toll für Passagiere, aber die Wirklichkeit ist: von einem wirtschaftlichen Gesichtspunkt aus ist das Airbus-Angebot von der Bedrohung durch die 777 gesteuert"", sagt Mary Kirby, Expertin für Kabineneinrichtung, Gründerin und Herausgeberin von Runway Girl Network."
1889	Airbus and Boeing don't offer seats, but rather a catalogue of suppliers that can be sourced from the airlines.	Airbus and Boeing don't offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers which airline companies can buy.	Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of suppliers which airline companies can choose from.	Airbus und Boeing bieten keine Sitze an, sondern einen Katalog von Zulieferern, aus denen die Fluggesellschaften auswählen können.
1890	Jets travelling round the world take so much measure to gauge competition.	The most frequent flyers in the world take special measures to measure their competitors' efficiency.	The jet-setters who travel by air are so careful they monitor their competitors closely.	Die weltreisenden Jet-Verkäufer tragen sogar Bandmaß bei sich, um die Einrichtung bei der Konkurrenz nachzumessen.
1891	Even though they offer the same level of comfort, all designers and manufacturers offer jet engines with high-performing designs for domestic flight and regional flights.	Even though they offer the convenience, all manufacturers still offer a wide range of jets and regional flights.	Even though they offer the best in comfort, all manufacturer jets offering more powerful designs for domestic flights and regional flights do not exist.	Selbst wenn sie den Komfort anpreisen, so bieten doch alle Hersteller auch Jets mit hochverdichteter Ausgestaltung für Billigfluglinien und regionale Flüge.
1892	Airbus offers an A350 with ten seats, but according to their own statement, it hasn't yet sold any.	Airbus provides an A350 w/ ten seats, but according to their own statement, no one has yet been sold.	Airbus has a new generation of A350, but according to its own statement hasn't sold any yet.	Airbus bietet einen A350 mit zehnsitzigen Reihen, hat aber laut eigener Aussage noch keinen verkauft.
1893	Airbus has announced before a short time ago that it is important for cabins to have more legroom and for some jets wide seatings on board.	Airbus has recently stressed the importance of greater legroom and wider seats on some jets on board.	Airbus has not commented recently on the importance of seatbelts on certain jet aircraft and wide seat configurations on some jets.	Bis vor kurzem hat Airbus betont, wie wichtig mehr Anpassbarkeit der Kabinen sei und für einige Jets breite Sitze an den Gängen angeboten.
1894	However, even if the only other jets in the world are making big modern jets experts say the demand for a new branch standard will likely be deceiving, while the demand for it could be mitigated by the well of the 777X aircraft.	Experts say that even though there isn't much support from other airlines, big modern jets may be set to fail on the back of recent standards, but they could be beaten up by the way of 777X-V.	Even if there's no other manufacturer that makes modern jets, experts say the reputation of a new branch standard will probably be shattered without the support of any other manufacturers, but the well-being of 777X customers could be shattered.	Ohne die Unterstützung des einzigen anderen Herstellers großer moderner Jets sagen Experten, dass der Ruf nach einem neuen Branchenstandard vermutlich verpuffen werde, aber von der Welle von 777X-Verkäufen ablenken könnte.
1895	Veganism, per se, is different from vegetarianism in a very significant way.	Vegans, as the Lexicon says, aren't totally different from vegetarianism, but they're very different from that.	Veganism, as the Lexicon says, differs from that in a very significant way.	Der Veganismus ist laut Lexika dem Vegetarismus unterstellt, unterscheidet sich von diesem aber doch auf ganz erhebliche Weise.
1896	In fact while vegetarians accept sahnetores or an intense flavour, these meats aren't allowed on the menu of a vegan.	For vegans who eat either rice, ice or a strong flavour of vegetables don't allow these spies to be permitted in their diet, the menus for vegans won't include these sloshes on crunches.	Unless vegetarians prefer sahnettoat, ice or firmly colored vegetables to meat, these poor-quality meats aren't listed on the menu of a vegan.	Denn während Vegetarier sich den Verzehr von Sahnetorte, Eis oder einem kräftigen Edamer erlauben, stehen diese Schlemmereien nicht auf der Speisekarte eines Veganers.
1897	Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the fat content on meat and fish, vegans are not allowed to eat all these dairy-containing goods - including honey.	Milk, cheese, egg, along with the diet that eats meat and fish, vegans can abstain from all sorts of dairy products – including honey.	Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the prohibition against meat and fish, vegans are allowed to consume all sorts of animal protein - so will honey.	Milch, Käse, Ei, neben den Verzicht auf Fleisch und Fisch lässt der Veganer vom sämtlichen Verzehr tierischer Produkte ab - auch Honig wird verneint.
1898	One wonders what remains, but a closer look at the vegan world illustrates a beach of inevitability.	While some might wonder what remains, a closer look shows that vegan food systems are characterized by a beachy inertia.	One might ask what remains, but a closer look at the vegetarian diet provides a beach-bound approach.	Was bleibt, mag man sich fragen, doch bei näherer Betrachtung zeichnet sich die vegane Ernährungswelt durch einen beachtlichen Einfallsreichtum aus.
1899	Broth coatings are very popular, says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the historic Reform House which offers numerous vegan friendly products.	Wheat-free sheets are very popular, explained Ute Henkelmann, the inhabitant of the hospitable Reformatory House which makes a lot of vegan-friendly products.	Cornflakes are very popular, said Ute Henkelmann, the proprietor of the historic Reform House which makes a wide variety of vegan-friendly products.	"""Brotaufstriche sind sehr beliebt"", erklärt Ute Henkelmann, die Inhaberin des hiesigen Reformhauses, die eine Vielzahl spezieller Produkte für Veganer bereithält."
1900	Reuben Proctor is very fond of visiting the shop on the dome.	Both Remy Proctor and Reuben Macdonald like the store in Domingo.	Reuben Proctor also likes to go to the store in the Domingo.	Auch Reuben Proctor besucht den Laden in der Domgasse gerne.
1901	"Seit 13 years, vegan dieting in the Brahms, he lives almost everything that he needs to survive in Lampertheim. ""In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian."""	"Since 13 years living vegan in the Brahms, he almost finds everything he needs to live. ""In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian""."	"After 13 years living vegans in the UK, he almost finds everything he needs to live in Lampertheim. ""In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian""."	"Seit 13 Jahren lebt der gebürtige Neuseeländer vegan, in Lampertheim findet er (fast) alles vor, was er zum Leben braucht. ""1997 stellte ich meine Ernährung um und wurde Vegetarier""."
1902	The next step was to take, so I became vegan.	When the century arose, the next step followed and I became vegan.	Turning the turn of the century forward, I went vegan.	Um die Jahrhundertwende erfolgte dann der nächste Schritt und ich wurde Veganer.
1903	"But the evidence came not just because of food, but it was due to the shoe selection,"" says Profctor, an art dealer who specializes in natural leather."	But the evidence was not only due to poor nutrition but primarily because of shoe selection, says Proctor, who said that the artist's pick is usually made from natural fabrics.	The evidence for the resurrection was not only because of diet, but also because of the shoe choice, says Proctor, who says the artist prefers to wear normal leather.	"""Die Überzeugung kam aber nicht nur wegen der Ernährung, sondern aufgrund der Schuhwahl"", sagt Proctor, der Kunstleder normalem Leder vorzieht."
1904	He realized that there are no such products in other everyday purchases.	He realized that, too, it's not necessary to sell anything without quality products in other everyday situations.	He realized that it's not possible to buy tyrical products in other everyday purchases.	Er erkannte, dass es auch in anderen alltäglichen Belangen ohne tierische Produkte geht.
1905	Vegan in the first place is animal cruelty.	Vegan in the first order is vegan.	Vegan in the first place is an edible.	In erster Linie ist vegan sein eine Ethik.
1906	"""I don't want that animals die for me,"" says Proctor, the head spokesman of the vegan group qui takes turns on the whole behaviour of the consumer."	Prohibition does not mean animals must die for me, writes Proctor the maxim of vegans who are disgusted by the entire consumption pattern.	"""I don't want to die that animals must die for me"", says Proctor, the head of the department of agriculture, who is trembling over the whole eating scheme."	"""Ich will nicht, dass Tiere für mich sterben müssen"", spricht Proctor die Maxime der Veganer aus, die sich auf das gesamte Konsumverhalten erstreckt."
1907	Statues like burgers, saucers or rubber bears hidden in the back of vegans soon found completely new products. Consumer enthusiasm soon rose.	Whether it is hamburgers, ravines or bearded dogs that vegans quickly discovered all new products, the demand for which increased as well.	Not to mention burgers, ravine or bears hidden behind, vegans quickly discovered completely new products, as demand for them rose.	Statt Burgern, Rühreiern oder Gummibären hinterherzutrauern, habe der Veganer schnell ganz neue Produkte entdeckt, die Begeisterung stieg an.
1908	"Vegans aren't always welcome and hardly ever get vegetarians to eat; but it's part of the package, says Proctor today, ""though at the same time they don't make vegan choices, so they have to make them own."	"The idea that a diet is better than a meal gives a double bonus to vegans, says Proctor today, ""which at the same time makes vegans less bitter and deceptive; it only raises the possibility of vegetarian eating options, but it puts them back onto their habitual place."	"It's a double bonus, says Proctor today. ""sadly vegans are not the only thing that matter, and they're not the ones that have the choice of eating options, but it's a subset"". The assumption that vegans can make decisions about how to eat better leads Proctor back to the habit of living."	"""Es ist ein doppelter Bonus"", sagt Proctor heute, ""tatsächlich stellt vegan sein keinen Verzicht, keine Askese dar, sondern es ist eine Bereicherung"". Die Annahme, dass man mit der Ernährungsumstellung die Auswahl an Speiseoptionen reduziere, führt Proctor eher auf die Macht der Gewohnheit zurück."
1909	And precisely these conditions allowed some, still in their minds, to give up so well-meaning attempts.	And precisely these concessions allowed some people to reject more lenient attempts.	And precisely these conditions let some even failed in so good a tentative.	Und genau diese Konditionierungen ließen auch manchen noch so gut gemeinten Versuch scheitern.
1910	The factor of choice is a very important factor that can make a person pick up a lot of things, similar to those that happen when smoking), says Proctor.	"The factor of choice is quite a factor which allows you to put on a lot of weight, just as when smoking does"", says Proctor."	The factor of choice is a factor which makes up for any fast-fire decisions, like smoking, says Proctor.	"""Der Suchtfaktor ist ein ganz entscheidender Faktor, der viele schnell aufgeben lässt, ähnlich wie beim Rauchen"", stellt Proctor einen Vergleich auf."
1911	"And one utterance: ""Good-bye mice aren't stable in the animal""."	"And you say something like ""best buds aren't sticking to the animal""."	"And he goes on saying, ""Good-bye mice don't stick to the animal""."	"Und wendet ein: ""Bestimmte Geschmäcker sind nicht am Tier festzumachen""."
1912	Often, it is the wines or the way in which they are prepared that changes the taste.	There are often the recipes or the way of making food which change your taste.	It is often the recipes or the way they are prepared that change the taste.	Oft sind es die Gewürze oder die Art der Zubereitung, die den Geschmack ausmachen.
1913	You can achieve the same effect on different levels, the vegan says.	It is said that you can achieve the same effect in a different way, the vegan says.	"You may achieve the same effect, but you can also do it a different way,"" says the vegan."	"""Man kann aber auch auf andere Weise den gleichen Effekt erzeugen"", verdeutlicht der Veganer."
1914	A grillfest brings some produce such as aubergines, mushrooms and a couple of vegans.	In a barbecue, you bring some steaks, mushrooms, and a little vegan cheese.	A grilling party includes eggplant, carrots and some veggie sauce.	Zu einem Grillfest bringt Proctor beispielsweise Auberginen, Champignons und auch ein paar Veganwürste mit.
1915	He takes care of a well-balanced diet, feeding it through the use of which it should also be a nutritious meal.	He eats a balanced, nutritious diet, with the intention of providing a healthy meal.	He depends on a well-balanced diet, eating which, as before, should also serve some tasty meals.	Er achtet auf eine ausgewogene, abwechslungsreiche Ernährung, bei der es durchaus auch einmal deftig schmecken soll.
1916	Of course, you'd better have something between your teeth. That is true.	Of course there's something between the teeth, right?	Of course, there's something between the teeth that's legitimate.	Natürlich möchte man etwas zwischen den Zähnen haben, das ist legitim.
1917	It's supposed to kill, but it is not just about killing animals, says Proctor.	It's supposed to comfort, but it's not just about reducing animal fat, said Proctor.	It is supposed to soothe, but it's not just about killing animals, says Proctor.	"""Es soll schmecken, aber das ist nicht nur auf tierische Nahrung zu reduzieren"", so Proctor."
1918	To prevent the spread of infectious diseases, a new and widely accepted assumption has not been met with success.	To address the risks to health until death, another widely-accepted suggestion was that he wouldn't make up his mind.	Health problems as far as severe aswelling, the widespread suggestion that he could not cure, however, did not diminish.	Gesundheitliche Schäden bis hin zu Essstörungen, eine weitere weitverbreitete Annahme, habe er nicht erlitten.
1919	For me, the transformation had a positive aspect.	For me, the transformation had a positive aspect.	The transformation had a positive aspect for me.	Für mich hatte die Umstellung einen positiven Aspekt.

"Your blood sugars are great; I often have to have them checked"", explained Proctor."	"""Meine Blutwerte sind bestens, ich lasse mich oft checken"", verrät Proctor."
1923	Vitamin B12, particularly before exposure to sunlight, gives a lot of vegans-critikers warning against cancer.	In particular, before eating meat, many vegans warn of the dangers of vitamin B12.	Especially to the point of forgetting Vitamin B12, many vegans are concerned.	Insbesondere vor dem Mangel an Vitamin B12 warnen viele Vegansimus-Kritiker.
1924	Animals that eat food aren't suited to humans, while it'll be difficult to tell if they're eating the kind of meat that is put in the fridge that have vitamin B12 in them, says Proctor.	Animals fed with feedlots are starting to mate, but eating the meat bought in the fridge is fragile, says Proctor.	"When cats are pooched by the hind legs, so how can they be fed? ""Are they allowed to eat fruit instead of lamb? Then, according to Proctor, the vitamin B12 in the meat that's bought in the store is a question mark."""	"""Da Tiere mit Futtermitteln genährt werden, statt auf der Weide zu grasen, ist es fraglich, ob in dem Fleisch, das man in der Kühltruhe kauft, der Vitamin-B12-Anteil hoch ist"", findet Proctor."
1925	Vegans will have the option to take the coenzyme via tablets.	Vegans get the benefit of taking this supplement in pill form.	Vegans will have the option of taking the coenzyme in capsule form.	Für Veganer gebe es zudem die Möglichkeit, das Coenzym in Form von Tabletten zu sich zu nehmen.

1927	We don't need to use the same route as a conventional food processor.	We need to take care of the food on its way.	It's no use crying over spilt milk.	Weite Wege müsse Proctor für die Nahrungsmittelbeschaffung nicht gehen.
1928	Everywhere you look, every supermarket has now soy and other products.	At last there's some basic ingredients everywhere, and now every supermarket has soap and other goods.	There is some basic ingredients all over the place and most supermarkets now have soy, milk and other products.	Grundnahrungsmittel gibt es schließlich überall und jeder Supermarkt hat mittlerweile Sojamilch und andere Produkte.
1929	Everything I need, I'll find it here.	All I want is to find somewhere.	Everything I need, I find it here.	Alles, was ich brauche, finde ich vor Ort.

"""Viele Leute übersehen, dass eben nur die Fertigprodukte teuer sind, aber so verhält es sich bei ""gewöhnlichen"" Fertigprodukten bekanntermaßen auch""."
1932	Vegan recipes are generally cheaper and less time-consuming than traditional ones.	Vegans tend to be significantly cheaper and less time-consuming than regular eateries.	Without this, vegan recipes are significantly cheaper and less time-consuming than conventional cooking.	Ohnehin sei die Zubereitung veganer Gerichte weitaus günstiger und weniger zeitaufwendig, als gemeinhin angenommen.
1933	"There is much to see in the kitchen; with a few small knives you can make good results but not get it all right"", says Proctor."	The chimney is full of holes, which in fact make it possible to get a few small knives into the garden, although not always with the same result as it may seem.	"There is a lot to see in the housecock; a few small knives can do a lot of good but they don't usually bring out much better results"", says Proctor."	"""In der Hausküche gibt es viel zu entdecken, mit ein paar kleinen Kniffen kann man gute, wenn nicht teilweise bessere Ergebnisse erzielen"", sagt Proctor."
1934	Using some vegetable juice instead of butter, a little more back-up and potassium instead of eggs, Proctor could turn his stubborn lean bodies into pots.	More vegetable oil and a little more sugar and coke than egg, Proctor also put his thorns in order by making his wriggles into mush.	Margarine instead of butter, a little bit more acidic and ironic in lieu of eggs, made popular by his vegan cheesecake, making both his bric-à-brac even more useless.	Margarine statt Butter, etwas mehr Backpulver und Kohlensäure statt Ei, mit seinen veganen Käsekuchen konnte Proctor auch seine Schwiegereltern zum Staunen bringen.
1935	Vegans are getting a new flavour with their family feast.	Vegans will get a new taste for family meals.	Farm animals give vegans a new crop of food.	Familienfesten verleiht der Veganer eine neue Würze.
1936	When you cook together, you'll have a new value.	When you cook together, we have a new standing.	It has dynamism when you cook together, and it creates a fresh position.	Das hat Dynamik, wenn man zusammen kocht, hat das einen neuen Stellenwert.
1937	"""The situations that can arise from that are just as different as people are,"" says Proctor."	The situations that can arise from this are just as different as people themselves, says Proctor.	"""The situations which can arise from this are as different as those of people themselves,"" says Professor."	"""Die Situationen, die dabei entstehen können, sind so unterschiedlich wie die Menschen selbst"", sagt Proctor."
1938	Yes, but he was taken back, as well.	Sure, but he was brought under control with scotch.	Obviously, but also the sight of Skepsis was brought up.	Natürlich wurde ihm aber auch schon Skepsis entgegengebracht.
1939	Don't you still get my food?	Don't you all cook my food anymore?	Doesn't my food taste good?	Schmeckt dir mein Essen nicht mehr?
1940	Do you want me to feel a little sick because I drink the milk now because I'm drinking it? In such cases, vegans have to answer with fingertips.	Do you want me to feel better now because of the milk I drink? In such cases, vegans should answer with a fingertip attitude.	Would you like me to feel better now for drinking milk? Those questions call for a vegan bent on the tip.	"""Soll ich mich jetzt schlecht fühlen, weil ich Milch trinke?"" - bei solcherlei Fragen müsse man als Veganer mit Fingerspitzengefühl agieren."
1941	"I don't lean against the people, I'm part of this society,"" Prosecutor says."	I don't let the people know I'm part of this company, so I will not try to sell any contracts.	I don't let people know that I'm part of this company. I don't want to violate any contracts.	"""Ich lehne die Menschen ja nicht ab, ich bin Teil dieser Gesellschaft"", möchte Proctor kein Enklavendasein fristen."
1942	A closer look at the everyday world does not necessarily reflect the vegan community as we might assume, and the vegan is not as restricted as the general public.	In more detail, the everyday world is not as vegan as might be presumed and vegans aren't restricted in life like people normally.	In closer examination, the everyday world isn't quite as vegan as you think it is, and vegans are not allowed to live their lives in the same sense wie mainstream social.	Und genauer betrachtet erscheint die Alltagswelt dann gar nicht so veganfremd wie vermutet - und der Veganer nicht so im Alltag eingeschränkt wie gemeinhin angenommen.
1943	Fast food is permissible, too.	Fast food is allowed, too.	Likewise, fast food is allowed.	Auch Fast Food ist erlaubt.
1944	It's everywhere!	There are some sandwiches everywhere!	There is plenty of pizza everywhere.	Pommes gibt es überall!
1945	Vegetable ferns offer a flavour of falafel or a vegetative yucca, says Proctor.	Some birds offer falafels or a vegetated yeast, says proctor.	"Birds provide falafels, or even a native yucca,"" says Proctor."	"""Viele Dönerläden bieten Falafel an, oder eben einen vegetarischen Yufka"", sagt Proctor."
1946	In a pizza shop, he serves pasta dishes, or he orders pizza without cheese, which's a question of habit.	In a pizza place, he orders pasta with fries or in a pizza without cheese, it is merely sanitization of the house.	In a pizza restaurant he orders pasta or simply orders pizza without cheese, it is entirely a question of habit.	In einer Pizzeria weicht er auf Pastagerichte aus, oder bestellt eben eine Pizza ohne Käse, alles eine Frage der Gewohnheit.
1947	The restaurants are getting up so slow.	The restaurants are opening so slowly.	The restaurants are putting up so slowly.	Die Restaurants stellen sich so langsam darauf ein.
1948	When I started to eat vegan thirteen years ago, it was even more difficult than it used to be to become a newcomer: You've got to listen carefully to people talking about it.	"Although I started to become vegan 13 years ago, it was still much more difficult for the New Yorkers to become aware of this development: ""You have to listen carefully to people who say that""."	"Having started to become vegan 13 years ago, things were much harder for the new-comers. ""You have to listen carefully to people who talk."""	"""Als ich vor 13 Jahren angefangen habe, mich vegan zu ernähren, war alles noch viel schwieriger"", kann der Neuseeländer eine Entwicklung ausfindig machen: ""Man muss mit den Leuten reden, sie darauf aufmerksam machen""."
1949	If there are enough questions, they may decide to add the menu, he hopes.	"If there are enough questions, they might decide to add the menu ""hoping"""	If there are enough questions, they might be obliged to add the menu in that case he hopes.	"""Wenn genügend Nachfragen kommen, sind sie vielleicht dazu geneigt, die Speisekarte zu ergänzen"", hofft er."
1950	Vegan restaurants are starting to take shape like McDonald's in Manchester or Bird's Kitchen.	Vegan restaurants are sprouting, as for example the cobbler's in Manchester or the vegan cafe.	Vegan restaurants are opening, for example the comma in Manchester or the vegan cafe.	Vegane Restaurants entwickeln sich, wie zum Beispiel die Kombüse in Mannheim oder das Café Vogelfrei.
1951	Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan menu on their menus.	Proctor wants other restaurants to serve at least a vegan meal on the menu.

"""Fleischgerichte sind dagegen exklusiv, und zwar im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes, denn sie schließen andere aus"", stellt Proctor fest."
1955	If you don't use plastic bags, veganism is a sure way to make the most of your food unattainable, says Proctor.

1957	Even if you learn to recognise that in trees and valleys the addition of aromatic substances may also contain volatile components as colour-blockers, you will quickly be able to fall back on the habit of following the instructions of the Ethik in so many droughts and falls.	Especially when one learns to understand that in crustacean and terrestrial soils contain tidbits of hydrogen as colouring agents, the follow-on of the Ethik appears to make one ditches so many shrubs and falls quickly without falling into overdrive.	Not only when you learn and learn that there are no additives in soil but in the case of strawberries, it is easy to turn off the cactus with the follow-up of the ehik and fall quickly.	Insbesondere wenn man zu verstehen lernt, das auch in Erdnüsse tierische Zusatzstoffe als Farbgeber enthalten seinen können, scheint man mit der Befolgung der Ethik bei so vielen Hürden und Fallen schnell der Mut zu verlassen.
1958	Not only that, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book titled Veganism - animal protein and its alternatives, which explains the many ingredients used in food but also cleaning agents.

1961	While he may not be entirely sure of his living arrangements, he can at least help to condensate the idea of considering his living arrangements critically.	He may not be quite sure that people lose their homes, but at least he can convince the majority of people to question his habits critically.	He may not be quite sure that he's taking his living things away but, at least, he can teach the common man to question his own thoughts about his living arrangements.	Vielleicht schafft er es nicht ganz, dass man seine Gewohnheiten ablegt, doch zumindest kann er den Konsumenten lehren, seine Gewohnheiten kritisch zu hinterfragen.

2897	To appreciate, there is a sharp increase in VAT and the income tax on the township.	To appreciate the overrun of all higher taxes on trade and the municipality's income.

2938	Either I think the partisan blockade tactics have cost too much to bring about change in our country, with the exception of changes such as an interim plan for national insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay to name but a few.	I also think that the polarisation of blockade was taking too many threats against our country to bring it forward: constitutional amendments, an option for public health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay in order to name only a few.	I am also of the opinion that political blockade tactics should have allowed too many attempts at change within our country to achieve goals: reforms including a ban on medical insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay for just a few.

2941	RULES can't explain why the ban on foreign prisoners of state is abolished or the ban on innocent children by murder.	The current foreign policy cannot explain why there are no protests against foreign national presidents or the murder of innocent children through slavery.	The repressive policy of blockade cannot explain what happens to the refusal of foreign nationals to vote or the killing of innocent children through murder.	Die republikanische Blockadepolitik kann nicht erklären, weshalb man das Abhören ausländischer Staatsoberhäupter zulässt oder die Tötung unschuldiger Kinder durch Drohnen in Übersee.
2942	It can't explain why the National Security Agency gathers data about the personal life of Americans and why whistleblowers are being ordered to report state mistakes.

2943	There's no way of making any sense for Al-Awlaki, a US citizen, being murdered without trial, yet also because the limits on government aid and expenditure during the election campaign are going to be relaxed during the presidential election.	Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was executed without trial, and yet public funds and expenditures were cut during the presidential election.	Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was executed without trial, or even if the budget and spending limit were changed during the presidential election.	Es kann nicht erklären, weshalb Anwar al-Awlaki, ein US-amerikanischer Staatsbürger, ohne Verfahren ermordet wurde, noch weshalb die öffentlichen Finanzierungs- und Ausgabegrenzen während der Präsidentschaftswahlen umgangen werden.

2945	Even the youngest could not afford to throw up a simple website for more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was abolished.	And even more recently, one can't deny that it's incapacity to put up with the simple website created more than three years ago since the Affordable Care Act was abolished.	And even more recently, it cannot be denied that there is no simple website to use since Obamacare repealed the Affordable Care Act a three-year period.	Und jüngstens kann es nicht die Unfähigkeit entschuldigen, in den mehr als drei Jahren seit der Verabschiedung des Affordable Care Act eine einfache Website zu entwerfen.
2946	I don't know if it is what I expected.	I don't know if this is what I had expected.	I don't know if it's what I expected.	Ich weiß nicht, ob es das ist, was ich hätte erwarten sollen.

The committee does not have a strictly disciplined course, as opposed to a national opposition party and unexpected events, such as the Newtown massacre, dominate public discussion.	The committee on order isn't in any respect a course of action when an opposition party and unexpected events such as the Newtown Massacre are preoccupying public discussions.	Offensichtlich ist das Abgeordnetenamt kein vorhersehbarer Kurs, da eine Oppositionspartei und zufällige Ereignisse wie das Newtown-Massaker die öffentliche Diskussion prägen.
2949	But if I look at those examples that you've given, they seem far from being elected by the government.	But when I look at the above examples, they appear to me much like a selection by the government.	But when I look at those examples above, they seem far from being elected by the governor themselves.	Doch wenn ich mir die oben genannten Beispiele ansehe, dann scheinen sie weitgehend von der Regierung selbst gewählt zu sein.
2950	And that's what bothers me the most.	And that bothers most.	And that is what most bother me.	Und das stört mich am meisten.

2954	Despite the drop in approval ratings for Obama by 45 % this week, this book has become so apprehensive as to give it an extra boost for 2008.	Yet with the vote for Obama dropping below 45% this week, the year 2008 of this book has gotten so ugly.	But the approval ratings for Obama fell below 45 % this week, marking the return of this book to the past year 2008 so much more heartbreaking.	Doch mit dem Sinken der Zustimmungswerte für Obama auf unter 45 % diese Woche ist die Rückkehr ins Jahr 2008 durch dieses Buch um so härter geworden.
2955	I hear the sights of the many promises that have come into being in the air.	I hear the scent of the many promises which have been made in the air.	I hear the sights of the birds singing.	Es weckt in mir die Sehnsucht nach den vielen Versprechen, die sich in Luft aufgelöst haben.
2956	This week I read in the book a section where Obama had to endure a heavy defeat against Clinton in the election of 2016 in Pennsylvania.
