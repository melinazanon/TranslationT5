Both the timber transport and the abbottling of wood in the current state of repair shouldn't be considered, argued Haas.	Because the wood beams as well as the beams in the current state of construction don't need to be altered, argumentated Haas.	Da sowohl die Holzabfuhr als auch das Abbiegen im aktuellen Ausbauzustand funktionierten, solle man dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs nicht zustimmen, argumentierte Haas.

Even though the risk of a collision between a vehicle on the way over there is much lower than that of other trains, the junction is directly opposite the stoplight.	A collision between two vehicles on the way to and from this spot is much less likely to occur than in other trains, because it's just beyond the stop line.	Auch sei an dieser Stelle das Risiko einer Kollision des Zuges mit einem auf dem Übergang stehenden Fahrzeug deutlich geringer als an den anderen Bahnübergängen, weil sich direkt daneben der Haltepunkt Mitte befinde, zu dem eine gute Sichtverbindung bestehe.
1269	Even a few steps from the mainbahnhof to this place should already be done so as to not cause a collision.	Even the closest thing to the mainbahnhof should be at this place already, so as not to cause a collision.

Selbst Züge vom Hauptbahnhof her müssten an dieser Stelle schon soweit abgebremst sein, dass keine Kollision drohe.
