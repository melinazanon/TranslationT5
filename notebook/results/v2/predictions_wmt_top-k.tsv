982	He noticed, likewise, that when dogs behave exactly like humans, the right brain part for the movement of the left side is affected and returns; both mammals play very different roles in feelings.	He aforesaid that in dogs exactly like humans the right brain part for movement of the left side is involved, and thus the two emispherics played differing roles in the senses.	He realised, too, that when dogs behave exactly as men do the right brain half of their movement on the left side and return, and the two mammals play different roles in their feelings.	Er bemerkte außerdem, dass bei Hunden genau wie beim Menschen die rechte Gehirnhälfte für die Bewegung der linken Seite zuständig sei und umgekehrt, und dass die beiden Hemisphären unterschiedliche Rollen bei den Gefühlen spielten.
983	As more about the reaction of dogs to their constant swings and their mannerisms grew, the forschers watched the animals as they watched these scenes.	As further evidence, to know how dogs responding to the increasingly difficult movements of their owners, the furrows gathered were watching the animals watch when these films are watched.	To learn more about how dogs react during their regular swagbuckling act, the forschers watched the animals while watching those films.

985	Probably we will soon understand why the chain of motion is heading in one direction, and sometimes in the other direction.	Probably soon we'll realise why the swing is moving in one direction while the other is moving in another direction.	Probability, we'll soon understand why the movement of the string in one direction is often wrong.	Wahrscheinlich werden wir bald verstehen, warum sich der Schwanz mal in die eine, mal in die andere Richtung bewegt
986	"Professor Vallortigara said ""We showed the dog films with dogs - either in a non-native version or a Silhouette to distract from other aspects, and we was able to control the movement more towards left or right."""	"Professor Vallortigara said that we'd shown the dogs' movies with dogs either in a non-traditional version of it or a silhouette to distract from other aspects, and thus allowed the movement between left and right."""	"Professor Vallortigara said ""We saw the dogs in the movies with dogs either a natural-timing version or a silhouette to reduce unwanted aspects and, as such, we could control the movement of the ducks' movements by either left or right."""	"Professor Vallortigara sagte: „Wir haben den Hunden Filme mit Hunden gezeigt – entweder eine naturgetreue Version oder eine Silhouette, um ablenkende andere Aspekte zu eliminieren, und wir konnten damit die Bewegung des Schwanzes mehr nach links oder rechts steuern."""
987	When the animals looked like a normal, undefeated dog, the swing to the right (from the angle of the wedel) dog left it completely relaxed.	When the animals looked like a completely unsettled dog that they had wandered to the right when it came from the perspective of the wedeln dog, they continued to remain completely relaxed.	When the animals, like a normal dog, the movement to the left (in the perspective of our wet dogs) was completely relaxed.	Wenn die Tiere sahen, wie ein ansonsten ausdrucksloser Hund den Schwanz nach rechts bewegt hat (von der Perspektive des wedelnden Hundes aus gesehen), blieben sie völlig entspannt.
988	But when they gradually climbed upwards, the tendency to join in was obvious (especially when viewed from the angle of the dog, whose head they were), so they reached out in a desperate way.	The tension gradually rising upwards, but the closer they began to look (the more direct one looking at the dog whose weeping), the more their heartbeat grew, and the more they looked uninteresting.	But when the tension gradually rose to links (as shown from the angle of the dog who was peaning), their heart rate steadily grew and they looked out for one thing.	War aber die Schwanzneigung vornehmlich nach links (wieder aus Perspektive des Hundes, der wedelt), so stieg ihre Herzfrequenz und sie sahen unruhig aus.
989	According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs will not interact in any way via these movements.	According to Professor Valeriano, the dog doesn't appear to interact together in these movements.	According to Professor Vallortieri, the dogs don't appear to be related through these movements.	Nach Ansicht von Professor Vallortigara kommunizieren die Hunde nicht absichtlich miteinander durch diese Bewegungen.
990	He's much more convinced that the dogs learned from experience which they should do not or shouldn't.	He's much more convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what to worry about in which movements they should take and not when.	He is a lot more convinced that the dogs were already taught by experience what they had to worry about and when.	Er ist vielmehr überzeugt, dass die Hunde aus Erfahrung gelernt hätten, bei welchen Bewegungen sie sich Sorgen machen sollten und wann nicht.
991	"He said that when different behaviors are exhibited towards other dogs and the behaviour of the dog with a tendency towards being friendly is likely to turn toward more friendly behaviour and on the right side be behaved less politely than at this point."""	"When various engagements are made with others and the behaviour of the dog swagging towards the right side tends to be more friendly in the way it behaves, and the right side tends to show a less friendly behavior then reacts on basis of these experiences."""	"He said: ""Whatever behaviour there are in different canines and the behavior of these dogs, whether a dog is inclined to behave more courteously or more politely, so respond on basis of these experiences."""	"Er sagte: „Wenn man verschiedene Begegnungen mit anderen Hunden hat und das Wedeln mit dem Schwanz in eine Richtung eher mit freundlichem Verhalten verknüpft ist und die rechte Seite eher ein weniger freundliches Verhalten produziert, dann reagiert man auf Basis dieser Erfahrungen."""
992	The researchers say that the knowledge acquired by dog breeders, zoologists and trainers could help achieve a better understanding of the emotions of animals.	The foresaken say the lessons learnt could help dogs be better at understanding their own animals.	The forekeepers say the knowledge gained by dog owners, tavernans and trainers could help to gain a better understanding of their animal's emotions.	Die Forscher sagen, dass die Erkenntnisse Hundebesitzern, Tierärzten und Trainern zu einem besseren Verständnis der Emotionen ihres Tieres verhelfen könnten.
993	John Bradshaw, specializing in pet behaviour and guest housekeeping at the Department of Animal and Marine Sciences at the University of Bristol explained that although this was not the first study to be carried out, it wasn't the first time it had been studied for link and right dog health.	John Bradshaw, the expert on dog behaviour and guest-feeding at the University of Bristol’s Department of Zoology explained that it wasn't the first study to be carried out on the subject of how links and right for dogs was important.	John Bradshaw, specialist in behaviour and hospitality at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Bath University explained that this wasn't the first paper which was studied linking links and right for dogs.	John Bradshaw, Experte für Hundeverhalten und Gaststipendiat an der Fakultät für Tierheilkunde der Universität von Bristol erklärte, dies sei nicht die erste Studie gewesen, bei der untersucht wurde, ob links und rechts für Hunde wichtig sei.
994	A team at the University of Lincoln found out that dogs can turn their head towards links when they watch an aggressive dog.	A team at the University of Lincoln found out dogs' heads curved when they look at an aggressive dog, and straight when they consider a satisfied dog.	A team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs tend to turn their heads after left when they look at an aggressive dog, and then right when they think of a contented dog.	Letztes Jahr fand ein Team der Universität von Lincoln heraus, dass Hunde den Kopf nach links drehen, wenn sie einen aggressiven Hund ansehen, und nach rechts, wenn es sich um einen zufriedenen Hund handelt.
995	"In a further research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, they said that ""Hunde go on an elephant if its legs are wet and then not narrow"", quite another example of how to be human."	"In another research study at the University of Victoria in Canada said things like this: ""Counties go to a robot when their links are wide and narrow rather than unreliable,"" precisely and specifically speaking in the Italian language."	"A similar paper done at the University of Victoria in Canada read: ""Hunde go on a robotic horse, when its 'twenty links' don't turn right and are instead irregular."""	"In einer anderen Forschungsarbeit an der Universität von Victoria in Kanada stand Folgendes: „Hunde gehen eher auf einen Roboterhund zu, wenn sein ,Schwanz‘ links wedelt und nicht rechts, statt unruhig zu werden – genau andersherum als in der italienischen Studie."""
996	According to his statement, the difference could also arise because the dogs in various studies aren't interpretable as dogs by the animals depicted in the movies or robots.	According to his statement, the issue could arise whether the dogs who are studied in the different studies are not interpretable as animals in movies or robots.	According to his statement, the difference could be that the dogs in the various studies have no interpretive roles for the animals in the films or the robots.	Laut seiner Aussage könnten die Unterschiede daher rühren, dass die Hunde in den verschiedenen Studien die Tiere in den Filmen bzw. die Roboterhunde nicht als Hunde interpretierten.
997	He says that a study of how dog reacts to real dogs might be helpful.	A study how dogs react to real dogs might help, he said.	He said he thought that a study of how dogs react to real dog behaviour might help.	Eine Studie, wie Hunde auf echte Hunde reagieren, könnte helfen, erklärte er.
998	As a rule, there are many different mammals that have their own brains used for many different purposes, but many of the details still need to be considered, however, and dogs are not the exception.	"Generally, for many different mammals the use of both brains being used for various purposes, but many details still have to be considered – and dogs are not an exception"", says Bradshaw."	"There's a great deal of precedent for many different mammals, so both halves of the brain need to be used for various purposes, but many details still need to be taken into account in order to achieve optimum outcomes"", says Bradshaw."	"„Zwar gibt es beträchtliche Belege für viele verschiedene Säugetiere, dass die beiden Gehirnhälften für verschiedene Zwecke verwendet werden, doch müssen viele der Details noch bestimmt werden – und Hunde bilden da keine Ausnahme"", so Bradshaw."
999	Their behaviour will not last long; it won't be long before we understand why the tension sometimes swings in one direction, sometimes in the other.	Since her behavior simply reflects her behaviour it won't be long before we realize why the tension sometimes moves towards one direction, other times in to another.	The way you characterize your behaviour is not likely to last long after we've figured out why the bar sometimes moves toward the one and sometimes in the other direction.	Da sich ihr Verhalten aber einfach aufzeichnen lasse, werde es vermutlich nicht lange dauern, bis wir verstehen, weshalb sich der Schwanz manchmal in die eine, manchmal in die andere Richtung bewegt.

1216	"How Dita behaved himself like a misanthropist, claiming that ""I wouldn't wait for a corrupt attorney to be what I was, nor would I want to keep information on Scarborough for 15 hours, so I wouldn't wait either."""	"Ditta sprained her beehaviour and claimed: ""If I were a corrupt attorney, what I wouldn't be, and give any information on Scarborough,"" then I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, but just the thing."	"Discretion was all based on self-evidence and a boast, said: ""However I would be a corrupt counsel who didn't exist at all or keep the facts about Scarborough for fifteen hours to do that?"""	"Ditta wies jedes Fehlverhalten von sich und behauptete: „Wenn ich ein korrupter Anwalt wäre, was ich nicht bin, und Informationen an Scarborough weitergeben wollte, dann würde ich keine 15 Stunden warten, sondern das sofort tun."""

1218	His codependency led to a hoffnungsless complicity, which largely made him dependent on the organised criminal groups who asked him for valuable information on policing subjects.	His hatred for bribery led to a hoffnungsless committment and, in part because of the motives which motivated the organised criminal group that requested his arrest, provided valuable information on policing matters.	His corruption led to a hoffnungsless compromise and, in effect, made him accountable for the motivation that some members of the organized criminal organization charged him with obtaining valuable information on police matters.	Seine Kokainabhängigkeit führte zu einer hoffnungslosen Kompromittierung und machte ihn empfänglich für die Motive führender Mitglieder der organisierten Kriminalität, die ihn beauftragten, wertvolle Informationen über polizeiliche Ermittlungen einzuholen.

1229	As the culprits for the damage had to be properly identified and the culprits for the trembling should have been early, there wasn't any damage to property.	Since the property owner realized that sooner and the hens were out on their way, there shouldn't be any damages whatsoever.

1232	The fact that the police didn't get to check his bicycle's collars near the scene has put the police in urgent need of action.	The police have found the man who carried his bicyclist's blood around the area, but because the police didn't need to continue to work the matter, it was not necessary for the police to do so.	Although the police had found the suspect with his bicycle helmets all around, it did not mean that the police were forced to carry on.

The Deutsche Bahn is going to improve the Kinztal railway line in the new year.	Die Deutsche Bahn will im kommenden Jahr die Kinzigtal-Bahnstrecke verbessern.
1249	The safety of railways should be increased, particularly since collisions between trains and other vehicles are often carried out nationwide.	In particular, safety will be improved on rail tracks - it is common to collide with other vehicles in trains.	Safety is especially to be increased on the rails: it often happens to collisions between trains and other vehicles.	Besonders soll dabei die Sicherheit an Bahnübergängen erhöht werden - regelmäßig kommt es bundesweit zu Kollisionen von Zügen mit anderen Fahrzeuge.
1250	When the council approves the renovation work, they have to contribute a third of the cost to the community, while others segregate tracks and bridges.

1252	There's the town building a bridge across the high street between the underground wall and the railway line.	They plant the town to build an extension of the ramble on the westside of the tunnel network.	There is the town aiming to build a bridge over the therein tunnel network west of the train station.	Dort plant die Stadt, in Höhe des dortigen Tunnelmundes westlich der Bahngleise eine Ausbuchtung zu bauen.
1253	There could be even larger vehicles that are storing lumber in the opposite direction, such as those to be transported in the street without having to block the lights.	They may also be taller vehicles, such as those which use the same length of wood that they are transporting in traffic, without having to block the lights.	There could also be tall vehicles, such as those that are rolled into traffic without having to block the lights.	Dort könnten auch größere Fahrzeuge, zum Beispiel solche, die Langholz transportieren, bei Gegenverkehr stehen, ohne die Gleise blockieren zu müssen.
1254	It's logical for builders to construct a necessary scaffold so that the city can widen its subsequent road network in such a way as to avoid clogging up the pavement at a time when it's too tight to travel without making sweeping cuts.	A keen planner should plan to add a necessary bridge in order for the city to be able to negotiate the following road ahead of time, so as not to have to disturb the flow of traffic.	A scout thus directed for constructing a necessary draughtsman to so as to allow the city to narrow the road to the next one without causing a significant traffic jam.	Grießhaber schlug daher vor, eine erforderliche Stützmauer so zu konstruieren, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße zu gegebener Zeit verbreitern könne, um einen reibungslosen Verkehrsfluss zu gewährleisten.
1255	"During a debate on the town council's policy on road safety, Thomas Kipp put the criticism with his ußering: ""Do we have so little money in our hand because there are so few cars?"""	"While the debate continued in the committee, some localities were questioned about the necessity of using pavement lighting: with his uvrant stance, Thomas Kipp raised the critic's question: ""Do we need to take so little money for so little car and so much money?"""	"The controversy was sparked in the town council, where some localities considered the necessity for a road closure: Tom Kipp made his objection by putting forward that the opinion of the critic was ""do we have enough money?"""	"Dies wurde im Gemeinderat kontrovers diskutiert, da einige Räte die Notwendigkeit einer Straßenverbreitung in Zweifel zogen: Thomas Kipp brachte mit seiner Äußerung die Stimmung der Kritiker auf den Punkt: ""Müssen wir wegen so wenigen Fahrzeugen so viel Geld in die Hand nehmen?"""
1256	"Mayor Thomas Haas said: the railway station's ""backgrounds"" are regularly used for carrying out heavy equipment."	Mayor Thomas Haas said that the track side is regularly used for long distance transport.	"Mayor Tom Haas explained that the rail line's ""highways"" are regularly used to haul lumber for long distance use."	"Bürgermeister Thomas Haas widersprach: Der Bahnübergang ""Hirschen"" werde regelmäßig für Langholztransporte genutzt."
1257	"Even wood from the area ""Kuhb"" may pass over this route because the fortified vehicles spanning the bridge would not be used to use the length of the journey to the station, because it couldn't take them to the main road."	Even wooden from the section of road will be transported on this route because the up to 20 metre long cars may not use the bridge over the harbour as they would not go in the main street.	"Even wood from the area ""Kuhbach"" will be carried over this route partly because those up to 20 meter long vehicles could not use the crossing at Hambleles, because they could not get in the way on to Main Street."	"Selbst Holz aus dem Bereich ""Kuhbach"" werde teilweise über diese Strecke transportiert, weil die bis zu 20 Meter langen Fahrzeuge die Strecke an der Häberlesbrücke nicht nutzen könnten, weil sie dort nicht in die Hauptstraße abbiegen könnten."
1258	Further than that, the tracks serve as extension of the lines intended to avoid using the tunnel when it is blocked up on the main road, argumentation Haas.	Further to this, the lines are being routed as a means of transporting those vehicles we may not use in the tunnel if the main road block is blocked, argue Haley.	Moreover, the length of the route is intended to serve as a conduit for the only vehicles that are not allowed to use this tunnel when the main street is closed, said Haras.	Darüber hinaus diene die Strecke als Umleitungfür diejenigen Fahrzeuge, die den Tunnel nicht benutzen dürfen, wenn die Hauptstraße gesperrt ist, argumentierte Haas.
1259	"Because it is likely to happen that tunnels and tunnels are built and maintained, as is the case in Wolfach at present, the railway bridge ""Argan"" could become an important traffic corridor for a prolonged period."	A major network link could also be extended if it is not already visible the tunnels and bridges on the Crossrail line.	"Since it is inevitable that crumbling and repairing tunnels on the Clydeberg will have to be constructed and erected, as it's happening in Wolfach today, the train line may also hold out for a longer period the ""bridge crossing"" on the ""highway"", as well."	"Da abzusehen sei, dass Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnel umgebaut und saniert werden müssten, wie dies derzeit in Wolfach der Fall ist, könne dem Bahnübergang ""Am ""Hirschen"" auch für einen längeren Zeitraum eine wichtige Verkehrsbedeutung zukommen."
1260	The raids broke in to let us determine what costs the proposed widening of the street would cost.	The rats began to consider how much the proposed widening of the road would cost.	The raids came to an end, causing questions regarding the proposed widening of this path or its extension.	Die Räte kamen überein, untersuchen zu lassen, welche Kosten die angedachte Verbreiterung der Straße verursachen würde.
1261	Considering the extension of the railway line, the figure for the height of the necessary bridges to be built by the city in the subsequent roundabouts to approximately 5,5m (assuming the line is wide enough for foot traffic).	"Nevertheless, the extension of the rail crossing was generally agreed upon by the measure given for the necessary bridge to be built on the same block of pavement as is extended to approximately 5,5 meters to the next line heading ""Central Line"" at the end of the tramway."	"Considering this, the extension of the railway station's extension with respect to the quantity of the necessary steps to be carried out on that stretch of platform, the ""railway interchange"" extending around 5,5 meters for the next line towards the station."	"Ungeachtet dessen wurde dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs mehrheitlich zugestimmt mit der Maßgabe, dass die erforderliche Stützmauer so gebaut wird, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße Richtung ""Bahnhofstraße"" gegebenenfalls für Begegnungsverkehr auf rund 5,5 Meter ausbauen könne."
1262	"The construction of the underground bridge at the Gerber's could imply a whole other problem, which the possibility of crossing the track over the steeply inclined ""Goldsmith's Way"" is likely to pose."	"The extension of the rail crossroads at the Railway Station could well be a whole different problem, particularly given the steep climb in the ""Geological Trail"" to the railway station."	"The extension of the pier on the railway line could potentially pose a whole different problem as the railway line travels on the steeply inclined ""Royalty Highway""."	"Der Umbau des Bahnübergangs bei der Gerberei Trautwein könnte dagegen ein ganz anderes Problem nach sich ziehen, das die Zufahrt in den stark ansteigenden ""Geroltzhäuser Weg"" betrifft."
1263	The construction plan for the train was considered by the engineer's office Breinlinger, having doubted whether the planned connection with the railway station should proceed without further steps.	The authority had been looking at the plans for the rail line from the engineering agency – Browning, as they doubted whether the planned connection to the railway station would be possible without further extensions.	The management had the plans for the railway from the engineering firm Browning, thinking they doubted whether the planned extension of the railway line would be possible further than originally thought.	Die Verwaltung hatte die Umbaupläne der Bahn vom Ingenieurbüro Breinlinger untersuchen lassen, da sie Zweifel daran hatte, ob der geplante Anschluss des Geroltzhäuser Wegs dann noch ohne weiteres möglich sei.
1264	The investigation concluded that it was unlikely to conclude that the traffic conditions on the road might lead to longer car seats.	The study came to the conclusion that it was not possible to conclude that the road conditions could cause traffic jams to increase for longer periods of time.	The investigation concluded based on the lack of conclusive evidence that the road conditions might lead to longer driving.	Die Untersuchung kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass nicht auszuschließen sei, dass die Neigungsverhältnisse der Straße dazu führen könnten, dass längere Fahrzeuge aufsitzen.
1265	It's the responsibility here that makes the city a traffic jam.	To blame here is yet another slain town as a road repairman.	This responsibility falls on the city, acting as a bridge.	Die Verantwortung hierfür trage wiederum die Stadt als Straßenbaulastträgerin.
1266	The rebuild could soon prove its worth.	The replacement of the building may soon fall into place.	The build can settle liability disputes soon.	Der Umbau könne demnach Haftungsstreitigkeiten nach sich ziehen.
1267	Since the construction of rail bridges as well as the abbottling in the current state of repair is inadequate, argued Haas.	Since both the wood export and the timber absorptions in the current state of construction don't need to be considered the extension of the rail line, said Haas.	Because both the wood and the timber blocks in the current condition of transporting the bridges, the construction of the bridge is not to be agreed on, argued Haas.	Da sowohl die Holzabfuhr als auch das Abbiegen im aktuellen Ausbauzustand funktionierten, solle man dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs nicht zustimmen, argumentierte Haas.
1268	Even at this place, the risk of a collision with a vehicle on its way across is much lower than that for other tracks, as it is directly opposite the junction point.	The risk of collision with any vehicle in this position is considerably lower than the possibility of collision with another station on the same platform, since it's directly across the line to where there's a good view.	At this place, however, the risk of a collision between a tow vehicle and a passing one is significantly lower than any other rail crossing due to the immediate vicinity of the station centre which makes a good-view connection.	Auch sei an dieser Stelle das Risiko einer Kollision des Zuges mit einem auf dem Übergang stehenden Fahrzeug deutlich geringer als an den anderen Bahnübergängen, weil sich direkt daneben der Haltepunkt Mitte befinde, zu dem eine gute Sichtverbindung bestehe.
1269	Even the smallest of buildings that can be found at this spot should already have been scuppered up in order to avoid a collapsing incident.	Every inch from the main building must reach this spot already spelt, so as not to cause a collision.	Even a small stretch from the mainbahnhof to this place shouldn't have become so steep in this section yet.	Selbst Züge vom Hauptbahnhof her müssten an dieser Stelle schon soweit abgebremst sein, dass keine Kollision drohe.
1270	"The rework of this bridge to the satisfaction of the mayor was delayed so as to avoid the ""problem"" with overcrowded vehicles, so the railway station would have to re-open after the construction works are done."	This bridge's extension was unanimously approved, so the city council had to deal with the problem with the on board vehicles, so that the road could be used largely in the sense that the railway line could be put back under the control of construction after it had finished its work.	The construction of this track crossing fell out of favor, as the town council needed to deal with the problem with the sitting vehicles, so the race would resume after completion of the building work.	"Mehrheitlich wurde dem Umbau dieses Bahnübergangs die Zustimmung verweigert, da die Stadt Schiltach das Problem mit aufsitzenden Fahrzeugen ""ausbaden müsste"", so die Räte, da sich die Bahn nach Abschluss der Bauarbeiten aus der Verantwortung zurückziehen könne."
1271	"Considering the construction of the platform bridges ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Kuhbach"", the bridges that have already been struck with the rail network have been considered unproblematically."	"Considering the difficulty of the crossing, the builders working at the bridges ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Barracks"", already crossing the rail track already, was considered a mistake."	"Although it is not a problem to see what the construction of the crossbridges for the crossing tracks ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Voor Kuhbach"", already junctions in the line have already been made with the rail."	"Als unproblematisch betrachtet das Gremium die Umbauten an den Bahnübergängen ""Vor Heubach"" und ""Vor Kuhbach"", für die bereits Kreuzungsvereinbarungen mit der Bahn getroffen wurden."

1613	The managing director explained that he wouldn't accept statements from employees, who didn't necessarily mean to contradict their previous messages.	The CEO said he wouldn't accept statements made by employees, so he wouldn't have done anything to deceive these people to do their pre-seen speech.	The manager said he didn't accept employee statements that they didn't want to be used to their intended audience.	Der Geschäftsführer erklärte, er würde Aussagen von Mitarbeitern nicht akzeptieren, wonach diese sich nicht getraut hätten, ihren Vorgesetzten Meldung zu erstatten.
1614	According to he, his association with Lord constituted much more than their trustworthiness, which she did not report.	Statually speaking, he said that his friendship with Lord had been influenced by her judgement much more than her friendship with Lord. This is why she didn't report him.	In other words, he said that she had much more close relations with Lord her judgments, so she would not report it.	Stattdessen, so sagte er, habe vielmehr ihre Freundschaft mit Lord ihr Urteilsvermögen beeinträchtigt, weshalb sie ihn nicht gemeldet hätten.
1615	"Hare explained that he told the committee of the YMCA NSW that the decision to pull the membership from the ""Jonathan-Lord crisis"" did not affect the employees' feelings, and the board has voted for him."	"Hare explained that he told the committee of the Young People's Association (YMCA NSW) that the decision to pull the organisation out of the ""Jonathan Lord-Lord Fall"" did not affect the mood of the staff and the board has picked him up."	"Hare explained that he told the board of the YMCA NSW committee that they didn't think the decision to pull out of the ""Jonathan Lord Justice"" was necessary because it came down on personal feelings, and the board recommended he do not take any action."	"Hare erklärte, er habe dem Vorstand des YMCA NSW seine Ansicht mitgeteilt, dass die Lektion, die die Organisation aus dem „Jonathan-Lord-Zwischenfall"" zu ziehen habe, „nicht das Melden"" durch Mitarbeiter betreffe, und der Vorstand habe ihm zugestimmt."
1616	Hare said the decision to ban employees from undertaking statutory duties shortly after the discharge of the criminal charges had been made by the headman of the youth service at the YMCA, Tom Whitley.

1617	"He said that it should be prevented from taking a broader picture of what the evidence was, though ""overestimated"" and misinterpreted."	"He said it would be OK to undermine evidence, but it was ""overreachful"" and poorly implemented."	"He said that the confirmation of evidence should only be delayed. That was ""overdue"" and poorly implemented."	"Er sagte, damit sollte eine Kontaminierung der Beweise verhindert werden, was aber „übereifrig"" und schlecht umgesetzt worden sei."

1619	He revealed that there were serious problems when it came to staff recruitment, check-up, grading, training and supervision.	He explained that there were serious problems with the recruitment, examination, training and supervision of the staff.	"He explained that there were ""amounts of problems"" in the selection, evaluation, enrolment, promotion, training and supervision of the staff."	"Er erläuterte, dass es „ernsthafte Probleme"" bei der Einstellung, Überprüfung, Einarbeitung, Schulung und Beaufsichtigung der Mitarbeiter gegeben habe."

1624	The two towers spread across the sky encircling 157 metres, making it the second tallest church building in Europe.	The two towers hung from the ground up in the sky, raising him to the second tallest building in Europe.	The two towers are sweeping 157 meters in the sky and make it the second tallest building in Europe.	Rund 157 Meter ragen die beiden Türme in den Himmel und machen ihn zum zweithöchsten Kirchengebäude Europas.
1625	A few visitors, who look admiring the two filigrane cathedrals, think there's plenty to see and visit under the cathedral.	But only a few visitors who admire the two filigraned courtyards anticipate there's a lot of interesting visitor attractions under the dome, however.	But few people who admire the two small towers as they stand to see the cathedral, which has a great deal of windowspanes to discover.	Doch nur wenige Besucher, die die beiden filigranen Kirchtürme bestaunen, ahnen, dass es auch unter dem Dom eine Menge zu entdecken gibt.
1626	Rainer Schulze is an expert in the subject of Cologne.	Rainer school is an expert in the field of urban climatologies.	Rainer Schulze is experts in the local market.	Rainer Schulze ist Experte in Sachen Kölner Unterwelt.
1627	The top point for his management is the Cologne Centre for Tourism and Tourisme located immediately on the Dom.	One of his top-rungs is the service centre of CTA's right across the Dom.	For his leadership, the CTA's 'City Centre' is in front of the Dom.	Treffpunkt für seine Führungen ist das Service-Center von Köln-Tourismus direkt am Dom.
1628	"The roundabout is quite unexpected: ""We'll get in the deep gang"", says Schulze."	"The round is quite unexpected: ""We'll start in the deep-sea compartment,"" explains Schulze."	"The route is quite unspectacular: ""We'll begin in the underground car park"", says Schulze."	"Der Rundgang beginnt ganz unspektakulär: ""Wir fangen in der Tiefgarage an"", sagt Schulze."
1629	In the ninety-six years that city council wanted to be an auto-justified city, so from the rest of its old town residents remained what they were used to, being as big as ever.	In the seventies, the city council wanted to form a fair city, and therefore remained independent of the rest of the old town residents just stood what was not too big.	The town council wanted to build an auto-justified city, so instead the rest of the old town hall stood only something small.	In den siebziger Jahren wollten die Stadtväter eine autogerechte Stadt, und deshalb blieb von den Resten der alten Stadtmauer nur das stehen, was nicht zu groß war.
1630	Consequently, today's users of the car park are speeding to the narrow bridge.	Most users of the park house are hurrying by the red light today and leave only their car at the station.	Almost all of the car park users hurry to the red light today, so they're just pulling their car away.	Die meisten Benutzer des Parkhauses eilen deshalb heute auch an den römischen Überresten vorbei und stellen nur ihr Auto ab.
1631	But more precisely, who look deeper into the parkdeck D2, discovered a fort at the foot of the parkdeck that was occupied by metal workers.	But more precisely, as one further investigation, one discovered a museum deconstructed by metal workers in Parkdeck D2 on the basis of a metalworking excavation.	But more precisely when it was raining, one by metallurgical remains found at the parkdeck D3 in the parkside courtyard.	Doch wer genauer hinschaut, entdeckt im Parkdeck D2 eine durch Metallgitterstäbe abgetrennte archäologische Fundstelle.

1633	"There are remnants of Roman wall coverings built in the second and sixth centuries after Christ was built up,"" explains Schulze."	These are the remnants of the Roman fort built during the second half of the First century after Christ, explains Schulze.	There are remnants of the Roman Catholic church built in the Second half of the first century after Christ was founded, according to Charles.	"""Es sind Reste der römischen Stadtmauer, die in der zweiten Hälfte des ersten Jahrhunderts nach Christus erbaut wurde"", erzählt Schulze."
1634	Before it again goes to daylight again, schoolchildren can still gaze up on the top level of the park and take part in a shallower, 15m-deep pool.	Before it goes back to early in the afternoon, teachers and pupils will be able to take another look at the top of the park bench, where there are a deep 30 metres of benches.	Prior to sunset, teachers can throw more than five metres deep into a shallower set of clouds.	Bevor es wieder zurück ans Tageslicht geht, lässt Schulze die Teilnehmer auf der oberen Parkebene noch einen Blick in einen finsteren, 15 Meter tiefen Schacht werfen.
1635	It's the old domes which rarely get noticed, unfortunately.	That's one of old domes that often fails to get used.	That's the origin of old dominions, unfortunately few are actually realized.	Das ist der Brunnen des alten Domes, der leider auch kaum wahrgenommen wird.
1636	The next station of the round is the Pavilion. Participants then descend into the deep again.	The second station on the line is the Pretorium, and participants will soon go down to the basement again.	Following the roundabout is the Pretorium, and participants go down again into the underground.	Nächste Station des Rundgangs ist das Prätorium, und hier steigen die Teilnehmer wieder hinunter in die Tiefe.
1637	We see the summit of what might be the tallest mountain in the country, the preeminence of the CCAA.	We will enjoy the most prestigious of mountain passes here, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Crest region of the CCAA.	We enjoy the summit of the most majestic mountain in the world, the summit of the Canadian Alpine Association.	Wir erleben hier den Amtssitz des einst mächtigsten Mannes nördlich der Alpen, des Prätors der CCAA.
1638	What does CCAA mean, one wants to hear.	What CCAA means would you like to know what it means?	What CCAA means is what a visitor wants to know.	Was CCAA bedeutet, möchte eine Besucherin wissen.
1639	"The Abkürung stands for ""Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinenean"", meaning ""Stadt rudimentary law and the capital city of Agrippinene, founded under Emperor Claudius as the seat of the Romans for the Kaiserkult."""	"The abkürung means ""Colonia Claudia Arippinenensis"", which in good German means ""Solo Alta rumus, Romanty and the Argentum, founded under Emperor Claudius at the Ordo Altar for the Civilization"""	"The abkürung for ""Colonia Claudia Arippineneum"", in good German as ""Attadt Rome's law and the city of Arippinene, founded under Kaiser Claudius as the seat of the Emperor"""	"""Die Abkürzung steht für ""Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium"", was auf gut Deutsch so viel wie ""Stadt römischen Rechts und Stadt der Agrippinenser, gegründet unter Kaiser Claudius am Ort des Altars für den Kaiserkult"" bedeutet""."
1640	When it's the subject of the debate, it's all around the former Parliamentary Palace, the imperial capital of the Rhine.	During the Pretorium, it is around the former Parliament building, the centre of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.	As for the Preachers, it's all around the old Statuary Palace, the center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.	Und beim Prätorium handelt es sich um den ehemaligen Statthalterpalast, das Machtzentrum des römischen Imperiums am Rhein.

Vom Vorraum der Ausstellung führt ein Tunnelzugang zum römischen Abwasserkanal, der hier auf rund 120 Metern Länge erhalten ist.
1642	You can stroll along the so-called cloakroom wall if you want to, or chalk up the guest.	You can stroll along the so-called Cloaca Maxima while you want to, and in case of desire, guests are encouraged to go on their way.	"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima just a bit, if you want to."""	"""Sie können ruhig ein Stück entlang der sogenannten Cloaca Maxima entlanggehen, wenn Sie wollen"", muntert Schulze die Gäste auf."
1643	One surprise has still left us with debt.	A surprise still has some school.	A surprise has still got to be a result.	Eine Überraschung hat Schulze noch.
1644	After he'd taken the key from the cupboard, he led the group to a depth of sixteen meters.	After he'd taken the key from the compartment, he led the group to a deep 16-metre-deep, thorn.	Having hollowed the key at the lock, he led the group to a 16-meter deep, bevelled treasure.	Nachdem er an der Kasse den Schlüssel geholt hat, führt er die Gruppe zu einem 16 Meter tiefen, begehbaren Schacht.
1645	"We're in Mt. Mikwe, a rituellen Jewish bath,"" he says."	"We are in Mt. Mikwe, a spilt lake which is home to the Mt. Mikwe, a deep-sea fishery"", he says."	"""We're in the Mikwe, a beautiful city of Jewish people,"" he says."	"""Wir sind jetzt in der Mikwe, einem rituellen jüdischen Bad"", erklärt er."
1646	The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground so as to get hold of the water that was readily available for the domestic washing up.	The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground that would allow water to pass to the base of muddy waters, which were impossible to tap in for the basic purposes of making soap.	The Jewish community built their bath deep in the soil to reach the underlying water, which was unbreakable for the washing up.	Die jüdische Gemeinde baute ihr Bad tief in den Boden, um an das Grundwasser zu kommen, das für die rituellen Waschungen unabdingbar war.
1647	As of today, at the end of the Mikwe valley, where the Ursprünge is heading back to eighteen centuries, diverse water bodies can be accessed through changing pebbles on the Rhine.	Today, at the end of Mt. Mikwe, the ancient lands that ruled the Rhine from the last century BC to the eighth century BC, diverse flows through the river are possible until the end of the end of the third and the end of the Nile.	The ending of the esh is nearing the end of the Mikwe, when the Ursprünge goes back to eight hundred BC, as different water levels can be influenced by varied pebbles of the Rhine.	Bis heute sind im unteren Ende der Mikwe, deren Ursprünge bis ins achte Jahrhundert zurückgehen, unterschiedliche Wasserstände durch wechselnde Pegel des Rheins ablesbar.
1648	The ruins of the city are part of an archaeological zone near the main square where work is to begin.	The Mikwe will be part of the archeological zone on the roadside to where construction work is planned to begin.	The Mikwe is to become part of a archaeological zone on the town's grounds to be used for construction work in the town centre.	Die Mikwe wird Teil einer archäologischen Zone auf dem Rathausplatz, für das die Bauarbeiten in Kürze beginnen sollen.
1649	Some years before the final slaughter will pass.	Several years until final assembly is needed.	The final steps are still a few years from the date of suffrage.	Bis zur Fertigstellung werden aber noch einige Jahre vergehen.
1650	Land Rover Road-Rally Rumble series is on track.	Land Rover Rally Series has been called.	Land Rover Rally Series is scheduled for next spring.	Land Rover Rally Series angekündigt
1651	They also have a conference room in the auditorium.	There are benches and cup-shaped seats in the intergalactic space, plus a freestanding speaker.	There's a meeting room and meeting room in the reception hall, as well as a reception.	Im Interieur finden sich Rennsitze und Sechs-Punkt-Gurte sowie eine Freisprechanlage.
1652	The options range from a full complement of equipment with technical support to vehicle lane marking between events.	The options range from strengthened brakes, a service package with support of Bowling Club employees and logistically supported support up to vehicle unloading between events.	The options range from enhanced braking systems to enhanced fuel economy.	Die Optionen reichen von verstärkten Bremsen, einem Servicepaket mit Betreuung von Bowler-Works-Mechanikern und logistischer Unterstützung bis hin zu Fahrzeugeinlagerung zwischen Veranstaltungen.
1653	Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, explained that the rally drivers who come to bowling have changed.	"Drew Bowler, executive officer of Bowler Motorsports, said: ""The rally-kits which come with bowlers have changed."""	"Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsports, explained: ""The rally-carving bric-à-brac has changed."""	"Drew Bowler, Geschäftsführer von Bowler Motorsport, erklärt: „Die Rally-Kunden, die zu Bowler kommen, haben sich verändert."""
1654	You're not all experienced mountain bikers; they're people looking for excitement and a way to world class competitions.	They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and cost-savings, but also seeking an accessible way to world class universities.	They are not all experienced racing drivers, they're people who seek tension and endurance and find their way to world championship meets.	Sie sind nicht alle erfahrene Rennfahrer, sondern Leute, die auf der Suche nach Spannung und Abenteuer sind sowie nach einem erreichbaren Weg zu Weltklasse-Veranstaltungen.
1655	We are looking forward to going this route with Land Rover and the MSA together, and we think that the format of these Rally-Distribution events in the United Kingdom and abroad offers new opportunities to experience and experience the diverse Rally-Disziplines in the UK and abroad.	We're happy to continue in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA; we hope that the format of new possibilities opens up new avenues for touring the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad, as well as new developments in the field of horse racing and in the manner of establishing race track.	We're glad to have this alliance with Land Rover and the MSA on, and think the format of new possibilities is bound to offer the different race divisions in Britain and Europe and to experience the new aspects of road sports and the real life of Rally Raid.	Wir freuen uns, diesen Weg in Partnerschaft mit Land Rover und der MSA eröffnen zu können und glauben, dass das Format neue Möglichkeiten erschließt, die verschiedenen Rally-Disziplinen in Großbritannien und dem Ausland zu erleben und Neulinge auf die Strapazen und die Wirklichkeit von Rally Raid vorzubereiten.
1656	We had really fun developing the Defender Challenge – it will become an undercurrent.	We had really fun developing the Defender Challenge game – it's going to become an extremely complex championship.	We had great fun designing The Defender Challenge - it'll be an underhanded masterpiece.	Wir hatten wirklich Spaß daran, den Defender Challenge-Wagen zu entwickeln – das wird eine unterhaltsame Meisterschaft.
1657	The Defender Challenge also has a training and test day in February and the option of taking part in the World Cup in North Africa and the Baltic States.	Meanwhile, there are a training and testing days in the Defender Challenge in February and the option of taking part in the North American Football Championship.	In addition, there's a training and test day in the Defender Challenge in February, while there's the option to participate in the African Desert race in North Africa and the Nahen Osten.	Darüber hinaus gibt es bei der Defender Challenge einen Trainings- und Testtag im Februar sowie die Option, an Wüstenrennen in Nordafrika und dem Nahen Osten teilzunehmen.
1658	George Kerevan: The European Parliament gives the Schotten the freedom to vote.	George Kerevan: European Union gives the slates the vote.	George Kerevan: UEFA gives the Schotts the vote.	George Kerevan: Europäische Entflechtung gibt den Schotten die Wahl
1659	A new day, a new era of independence.	A new day, a new chapter in the history of independence.	A new day, a new chapter in history of independence.	Ein neuer Tag, eine neue Schreckensgeschichte zur Unabhängigkeit.
1660	We're being warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen Road as a condition for the EU membership.	We will soon be warned that it is necessary to separate Scotland to join the Schengen-Raum as a condition for the EU membership.	We are now told that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen-Raum as a condition for the EU membership.	Diesmal werden wir gewarnt, dass ein unabhängiges Schottland erforderlich sei, um dem Schengen-Raum als Bedingung für die EU-Mitgliedschaft beizutreten.
1661	That's the defining word for stories about treachery in Berwick and, along the Hadrian Wall, it's a strong and secure border.	A map of the North East and a route with rail linkages along the Hadrian peninsula provides the basis for historical accounts of cross-continental travel in Berwick and securing border areas, as well.	This provides the perfect solution for stories of a Passovertroll in Berwick and a secure border along the Hadrian Wall, marked by stacheldraht.	Das liefert das Stichwort für Geschichten über Passkontrollen in Berwick und eine mit Stacheldraht gesicherte Grenze entlang des Hadrianswalls.
1662	In fact the Strathclyde-Vorlage was based on possible economic benefits, however in most respects that would take its place into the prospect of extending a more flexible travel policy in the restless Europe.	"Similarly when the Strathclyde vote was questioned on the possible economic benefits of a return to continental Europe, this obviously did not play any part in the banalization of the phrase ""freedom of travel"" in the current crisis."	Similarly, as discussed in the Strathclyde campaign about the possible economic benefits brought on by becoming more free to travel in the rest of Europe, it did not play any meaningful part in the debate over the possibility of increased travel freedom in the summer.	In der Tat wurde in der Strathclyde-Vorlage auf die möglichen wirtschaftlichen Vorteile hingewiesen, die mehr Reisefreiheit im restlichen Europa mit sich bringen würde, doch spielte dies – erwartungsgemäß – in den Schlagzeilen keine Rolle.
1663	No one mentioned that the EU states often adopt their strict rules when they are cheaper.	No one mentioned that their strict rules were often respected when it was cheaper for them.	No one mentioned that EU members often adopt their strict rules when it is cheaper for them.	Auch hat niemand erwähnt, dass sich die EU-Mitgliedsstaaten häufig ihre strikten Regeln zurechtbiegen, wenn es für sie günstiger ist.
1664	Since Scotland's not a member of the governing body currently, the upcoming reopening of the bridge would only be a small consoling act against what is truly wanted from the Scottish.	As Scotland does not currently belong to the European Union, its application for Brussels would be merely a small concession as to what might constitute a true Scottish citizenship, which is something you really wish to achieve.	Since Scotland hasn't been voted to the European Cup yet, the fortified non-provisional action for Brussels would be only a small concession against what is actually expected from the Dutch.	Da Schottland derzeit nicht zum Schengen-Raum gehört, wäre die fortgesetzte Nichtbeachtung für Brüssel nur ein kleines Zugeständnis im Gegenzug für das, was man wirklich von den Schotten will.
1665	It is no story either.	Also no story.	No story really.	Also eigentlich keine Story.
1666	"And one, who's already come to be a fossil in so many years: The first time that I heard the phrase ""Undependance is not just a passport"" before she was at least 40."	"And one who came to be a foetus so late in her years is that she is already an American: The first time I've heard the phrase ""Undependence = Passport Control"" in a magazine magazine back about at least 40 years ago."	"And one, who's come so late in her years, is already an even more distant prospect: it was the first time that I heard the ""Unabhängigkeit = Passkontrolle"" phrase used by the Europeans at least 40 years ago."	"Und eine, die schon so in der Jahre gekommen ist, dass sie bereits einem Fossil gleicht: Das erste Mal habe ich die „Unabhängigkeit bedeutet Passkontrollen""-Ente vor mindestens 40 Jahren gehört."
1667	This is an interesting point to keep in mind when remembering this historical tale lost.	This is an important point when preserving this ancient story will never bring us much joy.	Certainly, there's an interesting point when the same story is always repeated.	Dabei geht ein interessanter Punkt beim ständigen Wiederholen dieser uralten Geschichte verloren.
1668	Why should there be an independent Scotland expecting a dance after the European Penelope Dance?	Why should one expect a Scottish state to dance after the European Pie?	Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European Pixie Dance?	Weshalb sollte man von einem unabhängigen Schottland erwarten, dass es nach der europäischen Pfeife tanzt?
1669	Why is the Londoner Joch and the Brussels Bridge especially now being traded?	Why are the Londoners joking against the Brussels, particularly now?	Why is the Londoner joechi being used for the English, especially now?	Warum das Londoner Joch gegen das von Brüssel eintauschen, besonders jetzt?
1670	Those are true European facts: The large, after the wartime plan for union Europe is tidied in the stock exchange.	It is the really European news: The big, post war plan to U.S Europe is put in stock.	Those are the true new things to Europeans: The great after-war strategy to uniting Europe is in the form of a series of proposals.	Das sind die wirklichen europäischen Neuigkeiten: Der große, nach dem Krieg gefasste Plan zur Vereinigung Europas ist ins Stocken geraten.
1671	The project Europe was officially put off with the European Union.	The project Europe officially died with the European Union.	The European Union officially approved the project.	Mit der Eurokrise ist das Projekt Europa offiziell gestorben.
1672	To the extent of EU, all parties win Boden on the grounds they're deeming EU-favorable or the Euro as a currency.	All EU countries win all parties to the ground which are not EU-backed or the Euro as a Union currency.	Almost all EU parties win land to which they wish to remain, and the euro as a currency of the EU.	Überall in der EU gewinnen Parteien an Boden, die EU-feindlich sind oder den Euro als Gemeinschaftswährung über Bord werfen möchten.
1673	Even in Germany the conservative eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany – founded not long ago, with almost five million votes cast in the general election of September in favour of the liberals, thus effectively driving out the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.	Even in Germany, the eurosceptical party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – had about five million votes cast in the general election in September to elect them and, consequently, the free democratic democrates (which were equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the coalition.	Even in Germany, the European Socialist Party for Germany – founded only this year – could manage just over five million votes at the election of the Federal Elections in September and, as a result, exclude the Freedom Democrats (the UK Liberal Democrats) from the German National Council.	Selbst in Deutschland konnte die euroskeptische Partei Alternative für Deutschland – erst dieses Jahr gegründet – knapp fünf Millionen Stimmen bei der Bundestagswahl im September für sich ergattern und damit effektiv die Freien Demokraten (das Äquivalent zu den britischen Liberal Democrats) aus dem Bundestag vertreiben.
1674	The plan to create a European Union was already being fiercely opposed.	There was always a secret resistance against the plan to create an Islamic Europe.	The proposal to create a free Europe had always been hidden from the public.	Es gab schon immer heimischen Widerstand gegen den Plan, ein föderalistisches Europa zu schaffen.
1675	The heuristic is actually a turning-point.	The current economic crunch does not turn in favour of anyone.	The current economic forecast certainly does not stand well.	Die aktuelle Wirtschaftskrise stellt sich allerdings als Wendepunkt heraus.
1676	Due to the ties between Berlin and the European Central Bank which result in the appropriation of the appropriate national budget through the fixation on the common currency, many people think that the project Europe has gone too far.	As the Berlin Wall and the European Central Bank bind their strict Sparpolitik to the national economy established by the Festhalten an gemeinsamen Währung, many people think that the project Europe has gone too far.	Because Berlin and the European Central Bank are tied to a strict Sparpolitik in relation with the Zimbabwean Junta, which is the subject of the debate that the national economy will hold on to the common currency, many people think that the project Europe has gone too far.	Wegen der von Berlin und der Europäischen Zentralbank verhängten strengen Sparpolitik in Verbindung mit der Zwangsjacke, in die die jeweilige nationale Wirtschaft durch das Festhalten an der gemeinsamen Währung genötigt wird, sind viele Menschen der Ansicht, das Projekt Europa sei zu weit gegangen.
1677	The crisis of the Euro hardly helps national governments avoid incurring severe budget deficits – this was only Greece that fell into debt.	Euro crisis has little to do with national government incurring excessive budget deficits – that was just the case in Greece.	The euro crisis is little more important than the soaring cost of domestic consumption – that was the only fallacy in Greece.	Die Krise des Euro hat wenig damit zu tun, dass nationale Regierungen exzessive Haushaltsdefizite verursachen – das war nur in Griechenland der Fall.
1678	Statically, the Eurosystem has fixed its members' rates of exchange rate fluctuations which have been heavily affected for German exporters – and German politicians want to let this happen.	Statistically, the eurozone has weakened its member states on exchange rates, which are heavily influenced in Germany's exporting countries – and the German Politk wants to have it.	The eurosystem's membership in the European exchange system was festioned by foreign exchange rate shocks — and German politicians would like to let that happen.	Stattdessen hat das Eurosystem seine Mitglieder auf Wechselkurse festgenagelt, die für deutsche Exporteure vorteilhaft sind – und das möchten deutsche Politiker gern so lassen.
1679	As soon as there's the possibility of a local currency decline, South Europe with a marked productivity gap is again being seen to be different from Germany.	Without the possibility of a price reduction at the local area, Europe with an uneven productivity gap is again becoming Germany.	Without the possibility of a regional wage increase, South Europe is again facing an ad-hoc product differentiation against Germany.	Ohne die Möglichkeit einer Abwertung der lokalen Währung findet sich Südeuropa mit einem eingebauten Produktivitätsnachteil gegenüber Deutschland wieder.
1680	The only way is to cut back on salaries and expenditures – something that Berlin is planning to do.	The only option is to keep public debts and funeral costs down – largely because Berlin has banned the idea of shortening funerals and public expenditure.	The only possibility is to limit public and private acts – a trend that is largely from Berlin.	Die einzige Möglichkeit besteht darin, Löhne und öffentliche Ausgaben zu kürzen – angespornt von Berlin.
1681	Behind the current state and wage problems lies a deep-rooted European productivity problem.	Behind the current crisis of state and wage inequality there is a deeper than necessary problem of productivity in European countries.	Behind the current problem of the state and the economy is a deeply serious problem of the productivity in the European Union.	Hinter den aktuellen Etat- und Währungsproblemen liegt ein tiefer gehendes europäisches Produktivitätsproblem.
1682	When the resulting flood of green energy, the EU's industrial production pays double the domestic average for electricity in comparison with the US.	As result of the collapse of the Brussels corridors and the collapse of the European Union – an international treaty that reduces the costs of the French and German energy companies for the consumer – the European industry pays the double for electricity and gas, in comparison with the United States.	Due to the deterioration of the city's historic green energy policies, in comparison with the United States, the European Union pays double the rate of electricity consumption.	"Als Folge der von Brüssel verordneten „grünen"" Energierichtlinien – ein Code für die Subventionierung französischer und deutscher Energieunternehmen auf Kosten der Verbraucher – zahlt die europäische Industrie verglichen mit den Vereinigten Staaten das Doppelte für Elektrizität und das Vierfache für Gas."
1683	It's a cheap alternative to what we could already see in Grangemouth.	This is a hefty cost of living, as we can see in Gardening Gardens already.	It's a little bit of a thorny expense, as we could already see in Gardening Woods.	Das ist ein lähmender Kostennachteil, wie wir bereits in Grangemouth sehen konnten.
1684	Every moonfest in the world doesn't protect the European petroleum industry from getting caught up in billy American coal mining and extracting.	All of the lion's claims around the world don't protect the European petroleum industry from being deterred by cheap American pens in the corner.	Every splinter in the world is trying to protect the euro-European oil and gas industry against mounting bills from the US.	Alle Lohnfestschreibungen der Welt schützen die europäische petrochemische Industrie nicht davor, von billigem amerikanischem Schiefergas in die Ecke gedrängt zu werden.
1685	Similarly, a revolution is coming out, particularly in France, the leading group in the European Union.	As a result, a revolution is emerging, particularly in France, the EU's most influential leader.	A revolt soon follows, particularly in France, the EU's first-tier economy.	Als Folge zieht eine Revolte herauf, besonders in Frankreich, dem einstigen Cheerleader der EU.
1686	After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a Vespa; with Germany in chess and Paris in touch with Washington.	Following the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a Vehikel, whereas Germany was at an altitude with Washington.	France's elite saw the EU a Vespachy after the war, being made up of a mix of German and Washington at eye height.	Nach dem Krieg sah die politische Elite Frankreichs die EU als ein Vehikel, mit dem man Deutschland in Schach halten und Paris auf Augenhöhe mit Washington heben konnte.
1687	Paris needs not only to act as a Tor for political legitimacy, but Europe has a national economic policy, on the contrary to the defeated French economy.	But Berlin doesn't need Paris anymore, just the token of political legitimacy; Europe has its own economic policy, imposing its own budget on the back of the defeated French economy.	But the Parisian capital does not need Paris more than Tor to political legitimacy and Europe has adopted her own economic policy, putting up with the defeat of the French economy.	Doch Berlin braucht Paris nicht mehr als Tor zur politischen Legitimation und hat Europa seine eigene Wirtschaftspolitik aufgedrückt, womit die angeschlagene französische Wirtschaft zu kämpfen hat.
1688	The result: Marine Le Pens justice-elect, EU-wide Front National just won a decisive election, leaving the ruling Socialist Party at three.	The result: Appellants at the right-hand bench of Marine Le Pen, EEF National has just won a crucial election and put the ruling socialist party on position three.	The result: justice to the contrary on March 28th, the EU-style Front National has won a decisive election and put the socialists on fourth.	Das Ergebnis: Marine Le Pens rechtsgerichteter, EU-feindlicher Front National hat gerade eine entscheidende Nachwahl gewonnen und damit die regierenden Sozialisten auf Platz drei verwiesen.
1689	The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters. This is an admonishing note for the British Labour Party that can't let go of the fact that a pluralism in right-handed words automatically benefit the Links.	Front National is the second-largest party in France with 24 percent of the votes. This is a time appropriate warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot, by itself, be disadvantaged under an English coalition.	The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voting public. This is a time right for the British Labour Party, which cant be bothered by a shorthand spelling error would automatically benefit the Linke.	Der Front National ist nun die beliebteste Partei in Frankreich mit 24 Prozent der Wählerstimmen – eine zeitgerechte Warnung für die britische Labour-Partei, dass sie nicht davon ausgehen kann, eine Spaltung im rechten Spektrum würde automatisch Vorteile für die Linke bedeuten.
1690	What is Le Pen's newly-won popularity among white workers?	What does Le Pen gain in popularity amongst white workers?	What is The Pen's newly won popular popularity among the white workers of the working class?	Was macht Le Pen mit ihrer neu gewonnen Popularität unter den weißen Franzosen der Arbeiterklasse?
1691	She wants to use the EU referendum next year to block an anti-EU/Anti-Gemeinschafts boycott in European Parliament.	She wants to use the EU election next year to set up an anti-EU, anti-Government block in the European Parliament.	She wants to use the EU referendum next year to push an anti-EU/Aggressive measure in the European Parliament.	Sie möchte die EU-Wahlen nächstes Jahr dazu nutzen, einen Anti-EU-, Anti-Gemeinschaftswährungsblock im Europäischen Parlament zu schmieden.
1692	If the anti-EU parts of these elections are effective, this is quite possibly – and it's certainly possible – then a bloc could first rule the European Parliament.	If the anti-EU part of these elections are well represented – and it's very possible —, then in time they could dominate the European Parliament.	If the anti-EU coalition is well abstained in these elections – and that is very likely — then there could be a block of this type within the European Parliament for first time.	Falls die Anti-EU-Parteien bei diesen Wahlen gut abschneiden – und das ist sehr gut möglich –, dann könnte erstmals ein solcher Block das Europäische Parlament dominieren.
1693	This is the point on which I want to take an increasingly distant turn towards the EU and the common aims to abolish the Euro.	This is the point on which I wish to draw my attention. In not too far a future, the growing concern against the Union and the collective refusal to abolish the European Union will not find its way into the future.	This is the point from which I wish to reach. In not too far a distant future, the growing anger against the EU and the common cause for the demise of the Euro will not only come together.	Dies ist der Punkt, auf den ich hinaus will: In nicht allzu ferner Zukunft wird das wachsende Ressentiment gegen die EU und die gemeinsame Währung sich zur Abschaffung des Euro zusammenfinden.
1694	"The EU won't disappear; it will soon become something like ""the European Union of (souverän) Nationen"", which was backed by the Grand Duke."	The EU isn't going to shrink; however, they will become as European in character than the United States of America, which General de Gaulle favoured.	"The EU won't shrink, but it will get at least as good as the ""Europe of the (Soviet) Nations"" promoted by the Gauloisse."	"Die EU wird nicht verschwinden, aber sie wird eher so etwas wie das „Europa der (souveränen) Nationen"" werden, das General de Gaulle favorisierte."
1695	Germany and a few of its satellite networks may be heading to the Euro, but France and South Europe will have to reverse their own path.	Germany and a couple of its satellite networks might tie the Euro, but France and South Europe will eventually turn their own way back to their own accords.	Germany and a number of his satellite network may be set for the Euro, but France and South-East Europe will return to their own ways of living.	Deutschland und ein paar seiner Satelliten-Wirtschaften halten vielleicht am Euro fest, aber Frankreich und Südeuropa werden zu ihren eigenen Währungen zurückkehren.
1696	I expect that Britain will disavow this project in hopes of obtaining a permanent home in the United States.	I expect the British will disband this project in hopes of making a successful start-up America.	I expect that many British and other citizens of this project will disavow this project in hopes of joining the U.S's.	Ich erwarte, dass sich Großbritannien von diesem Projekt distanziert in der Hoffnung, sich bei den USA einzuschmeicheln.
1697	Washington's growing interest in the Pacific Ocean suggests that Britain should remain part of the Atlantic alone.	Washington's growing interest in the Pacific Rim is unlikely to be sustained by the United States, especially in the Atlantic.	However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific Ocean does not mean that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic Ocean.	Allerdings legt Washingtons wachsendes Interesse am Pazifikraum nahe, dass Großbritannien allein im atlantischen Regen stehen wird.
1698	Where is Scotland all year round?	Where is Scotland all the time?	Where will Scotland stay all year round?	Wo bleibt Schottland bei all dem?
1699	We can decide on a region of, by and large, Northern Europe.	We can decide, in the end, on a region of (at least) small England.	We can decide to be a region of (in the final) small English.	Wir können entscheiden, eine Region von (in letzter Konsequenz) Klein-England zu sein.
1700	Or we can defend our own economic interests - as well as Berlin and Brussels's ability to say anything they can.	Or we can defend our own economic interests – as did Berlin and Brussels to say what they can do with what they have.	Or we may defend our own economic interests – what is heard from the Berlin and Brussels to say in terms of what they can do, for example.	Oder wir können unsere eigenen wirtschaftlichen Interessen verteidigen – wozu auch gehört, Berlin und Brüssel zu sagen, was sie sich wo hinstecken können.
1701	I suppose Scotland could travel in a lockerer European Verbund quite well, if we keep our own way.	I think Schottland could easily get lost in a loose European verb for quite a long time, if we keep our own way.	I think that Scotland could easily travel to a European border in one locker, if we keep our own way.	Ich vermute, Schottland könnte in einem lockereren europäischen Verbund ganz gut fahren, sofern wir unsere eigene Währung behalten.
1702	Cooperation with other countries similar to our own is easier in an European nation than it is in a free state.	Cooperation with other nations that think like this is easier in a not-failed Europe.	The collaboration with other countries of similar mind is easier in a non-future Europe.	Die Kooperation mit anderen, ähnlich denkenden Ländern ist in einem nicht föderierten Europa der Nationen einfacher.
1703	In general, we should consider the necessity to leave it indefinitely and to keep our economic independence.	Ideally we should consider whether it really matters nor whether our economic independence is guaranteed.	All in all we should consider the necessity for northeless survival, keeping out our economic dependency.	Ansonsten sollten wir erwägen, es Norwegen gleichzutun und unsere wirtschaftliche Unabhängigkeit behalten.
1704	SNP in Scotland is the most successful political movement against the European Union, with a surprising majority of the candidates for (and against) referendum winning the labour government Alistair Darling and the subsequent Democratic coalition.	SNP in Scotland is, surprisingly, the most successful political movement against the Spartan policy in Europe and achieved a dramatic majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed (and pro-Secession) Kürzungen which the Labour minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Democratic coalition.	SNP in Scotland is the most successful political movement against the Brexit – notablely it won a huge majority in 2011 thanks to the rejection of the proposed (and not yet implemented) measures by Labour's finance minister Alistair Darling and the then-reform Democratic coalition.	Die SNP-Regierung in Schottland ist – bemerkenswerterweise – die erfolgreichste politische Bewegung gegen die Sparpolitik in Europa und hat 2011 eine spektakuläre Mehrheit aufgrund der Ablehnung der vorgeschlagenen (und vorgenommenen) Kürzungen gewonnen, die der Labour-Finanzminister Alistair Darling und die nachfolgende Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition zu verantworten hatten.
1705	Schottland would mock a decision on independence now only to get a Sparpolitik adopted then in Berlin and Brussels.	Schottland is ridiculously unreliable now and only getting an independent Berlin and Brussels then.	It would be absurd for Scotland to now decide on undependence only to then get a Sparpolitik adopted from Berlin and Brussels.	Es wäre für Schottland lächerlich, sich jetzt für eine Unabhängigkeit zu entscheiden, nur um dann von Berlin und Brüssel eine Sparpolitik aufgezwungen zu bekommen.

"„Je nach Zustand des Plans könnten wir die erweiterte Nutzung elektronischer Geräte sehr bald genehmigen"", gab die FAA in einer Verlautbarung bekannt."
1714	At the time, mobile phones, tablets and other devices need to be turned off when the door is shut.	Currently, passports, tablets and other gadgets have to be switched when the doors are locked.

The resit between the two sides occurred before the ballankering error and penalty handball; even though the score was so short as it was on a scoreboard, the presentation of the ballonners was often overruled by the referees during some tough match-day matches, the lack of any good player chances at being thwarted against a dangerous score in both contests.

Mai 2009, unvorbereitet traf, sei ein einschneidendes Ereignis gewesen, das die Frage nach Schutzmaßnahmen für die Zukunft aufwarf, so Häußler.
1799	An extensive area of hunting was carried out by the nearby community of Aston. This is now the basis for the floodwater protection concept in Gechingen.	An assessment of the region's vegetation was done by the neighbouring village of Aalbert, which is now the basis for the high water management plan in Gechingen.	A flood zone was identified in the area of habitation by the town of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the high water protection plan in Geneva.

1804	The watermass that caused devastating damage in 2009, described as having a 1,000-year flood.	The yearly rainfall caused to widespread floods in recent years was a 1,000-year flood.	The watermasons responsible for the damage caused by flooding in 2009 spoke of a thousand-year long drought.	Die Wassermassen, die 2009 in Gechingen zu beträchtlichen Schäden geführt hatten, entsprachen einem 1000-jährigen Hochwasser.
1805	"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,"" said Häuser."	"There cannot be absolute protection, but a relative improvement can be achieved,"" said the Händler."	It's not absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, says the keeper.	"""Einen absoluten Schutz gibt es nicht, aber eine relative Verbesserung können wir erzielen"", so Häußler."

Among others is the protection scheme presented recently in the village council, which was reported locally on the site of local action along the river Irm between the Stammheimer valley and the River Trent.	There's among other things the plan to protect, presented earlier this week in the council meeting, which we reported had local measures taken along with the riverbank tributary from the town centre.

Darüber hinaus sei man gehalten die wirtschaftlichste Lösung zu finden, so Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
1816	Mute was common amongst the elderly, who also at normal times fell under the influence of the canal network.	Mutiny existed at the crests of the ancient Romans which, when they did their normal gamut, were all bound to a cross section of the channel network.	Mute were prevalent amongst the ancients, even when they tended to be buried in the same cryptic network as the Roman Empire.	Unmut herrschte bei Anliegern des Altorts, die selbst bei normalen Gewitterregen immer wieder unter einer Überlastung des Kanalnetzes zu leiden haben.

The problem is known to the administration and first steps have already been taken.	Das Problem ist bei der Verwaltung bekannt und erste Maßnahmen wurden bereits ergriffen.
1818	Nevertheless, many experts insist that the guidelines for canals are different than those for high-water systems and will not be mended.	However, some experts believe that the guidelines for coral reefs are different than those for high water protection and are not in violation of the regulations.	Nevertheless, many have made the suggestion that the rules for canaries be different from those to which they are supposed to be applied in terms of high water and that it is not to be thrown out.	Häußler wies jedoch darauf hin, dass die Richtlinien für Kanalsysteme andere seien, als für den Hochwasserschutz und dies nicht vermischt werden dürfe.
1819	The community is required to build up the canal network so that it might be used for two or three years.	The municipality is obliged to build the canal network in such a way that it can be used for two and three years.

During the visit of the same café at the junction of the circular street in the town's crossroads to the University of Bremen, the cafeteria should not stand in the way of the national cathedral.	If you visit the same café on the corner in the town centre at the far edge of the university college of Rheine, it can not stay in the same kind of cold as a traditional French tea.	Im Falle des Besuchs des gleichnamigen Cafés am Opschlag in der Kreisstadt Kleve in Sichtweite zur Hochschule Rhein-Waal muss es nicht beim reinen Déjà Vu-Gefühl bleiben.

Bis vor kurzem hat Airbus betont, wie wichtig mehr Anpassbarkeit der Kabinen sei und für einige Jets breite Sitze an den Gängen angeboten.
1894	Despite the support of only one other manufacturer, major modern jets say experts that their reputation is likely to decline following the introduction of a new branch standard, but the sheer volume of 777X sales might be affected.	Without the support of only one other manufacturer, great modern jets are said to be likely to fail without a new standard, but the number of 777x planes could be affected by the lack thereof.	Many modern jets are spritely built without the support of any other manufacturer, according to experts that the reputation for a new branch standard should probably be debunked, but the number of Boeing 777X-equipped engines could be reduced substantially as well.	Ohne die Unterstützung des einzigen anderen Herstellers großer moderner Jets sagen Experten, dass der Ruf nach einem neuen Branchenstandard vermutlich verpuffen werde, aber von der Welle von 777X-Verkäufen ablenken könnte.
1895	According to the Lexis, the vegan religion is similar to the Christian faith in quite a way.	Veganism, according to the Lexika that Vegetarianism is underpinned, but differs substantially from this, however.	According to the Lexicon, veganism is different from this neologism quite a bit.	Der Veganismus ist laut Lexika dem Vegetarismus unterstellt, unterscheidet sich von diesem aber doch auf ganz erhebliche Weise.
1896	Even though vegans allow the use of sugar-treated veg or edamate to spread their diets, these foods shouldn't be included on the menu of vegans.	Because vegans don't put a large number of savoury food items in their diets while they get vegans the option of either pasta or edamate.	While vegans may allow the consumption of sahnetorts, ice cubes or any other heavy-handed meat, these treats are not included in the vegetarian's menu.	Denn während Vegetarier sich den Verzehr von Sahnetorte, Eis oder einem kräftigen Edamer erlauben, stehen diese Schlemmereien nicht auf der Speisekarte eines Veganers.
1897	Traders can abstain from all sorts of animal and plant products except butter and vinegar.	In addition to a ban on meat and fish, the vegetarian can abhor all the ingredients for dairy and eggs. Even honey is also used in the making of vinegar.	The vegan is free from all the veg and cheese, as well as meat and fish, and the consumption of nuts and seeds is permitted.	Milch, Käse, Ei, neben den Verzicht auf Fleisch und Fisch lässt der Veganer vom sämtlichen Verzehr tierischer Produkte ab - auch Honig wird verneint.
1898	What remain remains to be wondered, but if examined in more detail the vegan world can be characterised by a beachy diversity.	What remains, one can question; yet in a closer look, the vegan diet is characterised by a beachy fad.	What remains can be asked as a matter of course, but in closer examination the planet vegan is made up of a pragmatic approach.	Was bleibt, mag man sich fragen, doch bei näherer Betrachtung zeichnet sich die vegane Ernährungswelt durch einen beachtlichen Einfallsreichtum aus.
1899	"""Brottons are very popular"", says Ute Henkelmann, the emissary of the historic reformist school who prepares a large number of vegan recipes."	"""Brown peas are well known"", says Ute Henkelmann, the head chef of the Hungarian Reform House who prepares dozens of special products for vegans."	"""Brown cakes are very popular,"" says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the hospitable Reform house that makes a wide range of vegan dishes."	"""Brotaufstriche sind sehr beliebt"", erklärt Ute Henkelmann, die Inhaberin des hiesigen Reformhauses, die eine Vielzahl spezieller Produkte für Veganer bereithält."

1902	The next step was the passage of the century. I became vegan in the following decade.	As a result, I became vegan.	After the revolution happened, the next step was to become vegan.	Um die Jahrhundertwende erfolgte dann der nächste Schritt und ich wurde Veganer.
1903	The phenomenon came not just because of diet but also because of the shoe choice, says Proctor, who applies typical European linen for his work.	The evidence wasn't just about food, but by the choice of shoes, says Proctor, who is making the normal slipper.	"The problem not only came from eating, but also because the shoe picker wore normal leather"", says Proctor who wears a typical suit."	"""Die Überzeugung kam aber nicht nur wegen der Ernährung, sondern aufgrund der Schuhwahl"", sagt Proctor, der Kunstleder normalem Leder vorzieht."
1904	He realized that there's other everyday needs than food.	He realized that there were other kinds of things that do not involve tiers.	He realized that there were other everyday things to cooking without any animal products.	Er erkannte, dass es auch in anderen alltäglichen Belangen ohne tierische Produkte geht.
1905	In principle, veganism is a vegetable.	In general, vegan is a plant.	Vegan in general is an ehik.	In erster Linie ist vegan sein eine Ethik.
1906	"""I don't want to kill animals that need to be fed me,"" says Proctor, the maxima of vegans, who have a bad influence on all aspects of their behaviour."	"""I don't want to have animals die for me"", screamed Proctor, the maxima of vegans who are unreliable in all aspects of their behavior."	"""I don't want to die animals for myself"", says Proctor the maximis of vegans, who is resigned to all consumer behaviour."	"""Ich will nicht, dass Tiere für mich sterben müssen"", spricht Proctor die Maxime der Veganer aus, die sich auf das gesamte Konsumverhalten erstreckt."
1907	When they didn't think that there were any other burgers, rice cakes or gumballs behind the scenes, the vegan quickly discovered entirely new products which became popular.	Whether it was burgers, brownies or gumballs that were behind the curtain, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products. The popularity of these foods quickly grew exponentially.	Stating burgers, rice cakes or gumballs behind the scenes, the vegan quickly discovered entirely new products that were rising in popularity.	Statt Burgern, Rühreiern oder Gummibären hinterherzutrauern, habe der Veganer schnell ganz neue Produkte entdeckt, die Begeisterung stieg an.
1908	"""There is a double bonus,"" says Proctor today saying ""at once veganism is not a sache, neither assimilate, but it's a matter"". The assumption that man can change his diet to the decision of which he likes to eat, leads Proctor back to the making of the habit."	"It's a double bonus, he says today; ""being vegan isn't necessarily making sense, not having asses to come into the table,"" Proctor says in favour of the decision on the food choices and eating options puts the future of food on the back of the mind."	"""It's a double bonus,"" says Proctor today: ""for the moment vegan isn't a vegetarian, for there are askese; it's a field"" Proctor's assumption that choosing the foods and condiments is a choice, eventually making him the ruler of the household."	"""Es ist ein doppelter Bonus"", sagt Proctor heute, ""tatsächlich stellt vegan sein keinen Verzicht, keine Askese dar, sondern es ist eine Bereicherung"". Die Annahme, dass man mit der Ernährungsumstellung die Auswahl an Speiseoptionen reduziere, führt Proctor eher auf die Macht der Gewohnheit zurück."
1909	Likewise these conditions made sure even some so good-intentioned attempts, even though they were more common than those that had been made by the original author.	Exactly these concessions made even some of the more well-known attempts to make use of them so well.	And exactly these concessions also snatched out even the most grundened of experiments.	Und genau diese Konditionierungen ließen auch manchen noch so gut gemeinten Versuch scheitern.
1910	The factors that determine your search is a really important factor which can be quickly determined, similar to how to smoke for example, puts Proctor on the mark of comparison.	Such a factor is largely decisive to what makes one pick out, like a smoking habit, Proctor suggests.	The search factor is a very important factor that can be changed easily in the form of tobacco, and Proctor is making a comparison.	"""Der Suchtfaktor ist ein ganz entscheidender Faktor, der viele schnell aufgeben lässt, ähnlich wie beim Rauchen"", stellt Proctor einen Vergleich auf."
1911	"And ends with the phrase, ""Most beautiful butterflies are not at all on their way to the animals""."	And turns round: 'Best sellers are not for the faintest of tastes.	And says that a certain number of gems are not in the family.	"Und wendet ein: ""Bestimmte Geschmäcker sind nicht am Tier festzumachen""."
1912	The tastes or the ingredients that make up a dish are often the same.	It is often the flavour of the drinks and the way they are prepared that make the taste.	It's often the food or the way of making that taste.	Oft sind es die Gewürze oder die Art der Zubereitung, die den Geschmack ausmachen.
1913	One can also bring about the same effect in other ways, the vegan expresses.	Man can cause the same effect on other levels, says the vegan.	"Man can produce the same effect on other occasions,"" explains the vegan."	"""Man kann aber auch auf andere Weise den gleichen Effekt erzeugen"", verdeutlicht der Veganer."
1914	Proctor brings some extras to a grillfest, for example aubergine, carrot juice and even a few vegan wafers.	A barbecue gives Proctor examples of aubergine, chowder and vegan cheese.	To a grilling event, Proctor brings with them a selection of aubergine, carrots, and even nutmeg.	Zu einem Grillfest bringt Proctor beispielsweise Auberginen, Champignons und auch ein paar Veganwürste mit.
1915	He is trying to eat well, which he's getting fed with a balanced diet, which he doesn't like to lose for too long.	He tries to eat an ewogene and a balanced diet, consuming it all at once.	He is eating an a balanced and healthy diet, with a conscious effort to eat something more nutritious.	Er achtet auf eine ausgewogene, abwechslungsreiche Ernährung, bei der es durchaus auch einmal deftig schmecken soll.
1916	Of course, one wants somewhere between the teeth, that's valid.	Obviously there would be some space between teeth, but that's right.	Of course, there's something between the teeth that is legitimate.	Natürlich möchte man etwas zwischen den Zähnen haben, das ist legitim.
1917	It's supposed to eat, but it's not just for dietary purposes, so Proctor.	"They say it's supposed to sooth, but that's not only on food of the kind,"" says Proctor."	It's supposed to sooth, but it isn't just for tier one food.	"""Es soll schmecken, aber das ist nicht nur auf tierische Nahrung zu reduzieren"", so Proctor."
1918	He has not been able to heal from the injuries brought on by the outbreak of encesthetic syndrome, an additional extensive cause.

Gesundheitliche Schäden bis hin zu Essstörungen, eine weitere weitverbreitete Annahme, habe er nicht erlitten.

1921	There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan food.	There are sports athletes who eat nothing but vegan food.	There are high performance athletes who only eat non-vegan foods.	Es gibt Hochleistungsathleten, die sich ausschließlich vegan ernähren.
1922	"His blood values are good, I often get my blood tested"", he said."	"Their blood values are good, I often have to go and check my blood sugars,"" screamed Proctor."	"My blood type is the best, I often get my check-ups"", said the proctor."	"""Meine Blutwerte sind bestens, ich lasse mich oft checken"", verrät Proctor."
1923	Especially in relation to the guana, many vegans warn of the dangers of vitamin B12.	The introduction of vitamin B12 to many vegans is dangerous, for example.	Even before the poisoning, a lot of vegans claim vitamin B12 is bad for health.	Insbesondere vor dem Mangel an Vitamin B12 warnen viele Vegansimus-Kritiker.
1924	Veggies that contain artificial sweeteners are a bit easier than meat which is prepared for consumption; it is fragile to say that in the fridge jar there's a vitamin B12-Anthoxidy.	Various animal breeds that require adding fats, but depending on the species eaten, it is doubtful whether the meat you buy includes vitamins B12, said Proctor.	In terms of the manner in which animals are fed, rather than the manner in which they are fed, it may be doubtful whether the meat that you buy has a good supply vitamin A B12. Proctor says that he thinks that the proportion of fat used to make these animals is high.	"""Da Tiere mit Futtermitteln genährt werden, statt auf der Weide zu grasen, ist es fraglich, ob in dem Fleisch, das man in der Kühltruhe kauft, der Vitamin-B12-Anteil hoch ist"", findet Proctor."
1925	For vegans there is the possibility of taking the coenzyme in form of tablets.	Vegans may enjoy taking the juice in tablet form.	Vegans are given the option to take the coenzyme in form of tablets.	Für Veganer gebe es zudem die Möglichkeit, das Coenzym in Form von Tabletten zu sich zu nehmen.
1926	"His B12 tyres are in order,"" he says."	My B12 cards are in order, he says.	His B12 jars are OK, he says.	"""Meine B12-Werte sind in Ordnung"", erklärt er."
1927	We don't have to go to the proctor for the supply of food.	We don't need to go to the proctor for the food production.	We have to go through the manufacture of foodstuffs.	Weite Wege müsse Proctor für die Nahrungsmittelbeschaffung nicht gehen.
1928	Every supermarket sells soap and other products nowadays.	There are a lot of basic ingredients around, and every supermarket now has soap and other products.	Eventually there is widespread use of basic nutrients at any supermarket, where there are soaps and other products now.	Grundnahrungsmittel gibt es schließlich überall und jeder Supermarkt hat mittlerweile Sojamilch und andere Produkte.
1929	I'll be nearing an orphanage all the time I need to.	All I need is a place for everything that I need.	I will find whatever I need in an office.	Alles, was ich brauche, finde ich vor Ort.

1931	"""Viel people often see that fertilizers are expensive, but it's the same for ""normal"" Fertilizers."""

"Some people notice that just the fertilizer is expensive, but it's true of ""grounded"" fertilizers as well."""	"""Viele Leute übersehen, dass eben nur die Fertigprodukte teuer sind, aber so verhält es sich bei ""gewöhnlichen"" Fertigprodukten bekanntermaßen auch""."
1932	Vegan food is much less expensive and more time-consuming than other traditional dishes.	Withouthin, the preparation of vegan meals is much cheaper and less time-consuming than normal preparation.	Withouthin, the preparation of vegan dishes is far more cost-effective and time-consuming than putting them together.	Ohnehin sei die Zubereitung veganer Gerichte weitaus günstiger und weniger zeitaufwendig, als gemeinhin angenommen.
1933	There is a lot of discovery in the home furnishing, and you can get good results with just a couple small knives, says Proctor.	"There is a lot of work in the kitchen, so a few little knives can do good, even better,"" says Proctor."	There is much to discover in the household - with a few small knives one can achieve good results, though not very good results.	"""In der Hausküche gibt es viel zu entdecken, mit ein paar kleinen Kniffen kann man gute, wenn nicht teilweise bessere Ergebnisse erzielen"", sagt Proctor."
1934	With his vegan cheesecake, marrow and almonds instead of butter, a little extra sugar and carbon dioxide could turn into some cake, and Proctor's vegan cheesecake could also turn into jam.	Margarine instead of butter, a bit more hydrogen and co2 to bake in, and the vegan cheesecake was easy to make with his vegan cheese.	Margarine instead of butter, a little more sugar and Kohlensäure could transform into jams even though Proctor's cheese was a vegan cheesecake.	Margarine statt Butter, etwas mehr Backpulver und Kohlensäure statt Ei, mit seinen veganen Käsekuchen konnte Proctor auch seine Schwiegereltern zum Staunen bringen.

1937	The situations which can arise as a result of this are so different from the people themselves, says Proctor.	The situations caused by it are as different to the people themselves, says Proctor.	"The situations, which come in to be thrown into being, are as diverse as the people themselves,"" he says."	"""Die Situationen, die dabei entstehen können, sind so unterschiedlich wie die Menschen selbst"", sagt Proctor."
1938	He, of course did get sockeye but also was given the treatment.	He did indeed get streptis, however it was already suspected.	Of course he also got the staph, but this time, he has already been treated for pepsis.	Natürlich wurde ihm aber auch schon Skepsis entgegengebracht.
1939	Don't you eat my food anymore?	Don't you eat my food anymore?	Don't you eat my food anymore?	Schmeckt dir mein Essen nicht mehr?
1940	"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk? ""How can you say that vegans have fingertip feeling?"""	"Do you want me to feel bad now because I drink milk? ""In such cases, it's essential to understand veganism."""	Do you want me feeling bad now that I drink milk? In such a scenario, it makes good sense to act vegan.	"""Soll ich mich jetzt schlecht fühlen, weil ich Milch trinke?"" - bei solcherlei Fragen müsse man als Veganer mit Fingerspitzengefühl agieren."
1941	"I won't tolerate people, I'm part of this company,"" - Proctor no formal formalities."	"I'm not a racist, I am part of this company"", Proctor says he does not want to get a confession on any personal matters."	"I am not affiliated to this company, but I'm part of that group."""	"""Ich lehne die Menschen ja nicht ab, ich bin Teil dieser Gesellschaft"", möchte Proctor kein Enklavendasein fristen."
1942	Further to look at this, the everyday world isn't exactly as vegan as thought - and the vegan does not appear as restricted in the way that it is often perceived.	And closer examine, the everyday world seems not to be as vegan as hoped. And the vegan isn't restricted in what they say are strictly beliefs.	And further than that, the everyday world isn't as vegan as it seems — and the vegan is not included in everyday as much as most people think they are.	Und genauer betrachtet erscheint die Alltagswelt dann gar nicht so veganfremd wie vermutet - und der Veganer nicht so im Alltag eingeschränkt wie gemeinhin angenommen.
1943	Likewise, fast food is allowed.	Even fast food is allowed.	Fast food is allowed, too.	Auch Fast Food ist erlaubt.

"Some vegetables give rise to falafel, or even a vegetable juice,"" Proctor says."	"""Viele Dönerläden bieten Falafel an, oder eben einen vegetarischen Yufka"", sagt Proctor."
1946	He's eating pasta at a restaurant or simply ordering a pizza without cheese, it all is a matter of habit.	He's often tempted to eat pasta at a pizza restaurant, or perhaps make a cheeseloaf sandwich, that's all a matter of location.	He might have pasta dishes at a pizza shop or he just wants to order a pizza without cheese, it's all a matter of place.	In einer Pizzeria weicht er auf Pastagerichte aus, oder bestellt eben eine Pizza ohne Käse, alles eine Frage der Gewohnheit.
1947	The restaurants are taking notice so slowly.	The restaurants are starting to change their minds so slowly.	Restaurants are rushing to serve it up so slowly.	Die Restaurants stellen sich so langsam darauf ein.

1951	Proctor is hoping that restaurants will have at least one vegan option on the menu.	Proctor heaved the wish that other restaurants have vegan menus at least.

Proctor hegt den Wunsch, dass auch andere Restaurants zumindest ein veganes Gericht auf der Speisekarte stehen haben.
1952	Among the dishes that are made of vegan raw materials are used for everyone.	The basics used are vegan recipes for everybody.	There are vegan dishes in general for everyone.	Im Grunde genommen sind vegane Gerichte für alle da.
1953	They can eat, but they are also exactly opposites to regular eating.	They can eat anyone, but they are exactly the opposite of ordinary.	They can be eaten by anyone, but they're just the opposite of exclusive.	Jeder kann sie essen, sie sind also genau das Gegenteil von exklusiv.
1954	"Floss plates are not cheap, in the spirit of their word ""because they separate others"", according to Proctor."	"The phrase ""lipstick meals aren't exclusively for the discerning palate, but in the true sense of the word, they just separate one another"", says Proctor."

"""Fleischgerichte sind dagegen exklusiv, und zwar im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes, denn sie schließen andere aus"", stellt Proctor fest."
1955	Whilst you don't want food stains in your mouth, veganism is certainly not the least bit impossible to make, says Proctor.	"Where you want to avoid foods that contain gluten, veganism is a sure way to make the largest part of the food chain impossible,"" says Proctor."	"When you don't want to use ingredients such as ketchup, veganism is an absolute necessity that nearly all of us can't afford to do it in their entirety"", says Proctor."

1957	Even if one learns that all vegetable and tree-based additives can contain dye, as the progression of the path towards a garden soon seems to be a very wise choice when there is so many hedges and fall fields to choose from.	Not a lot when you learn to understand how in mountain valleys the addition of various additives can contain its colour, but with the introduction of the Ethik in such a large number of hills and valleys quickly become mute.	Even if we learn to understand that there are many tiers of additives in soils, it seems obvious to be the only one who's willing to follow the path of so many hills and fall as to quickly become abandoned when we climb up an a hill so steeply.	Insbesondere wenn man zu verstehen lernt, das auch in Erdnüsse tierische Zusatzstoffe als Farbgeber enthalten seinen können, scheint man mit der Befolgung der Ethik bei so vielen Hürden und Fallen schnell der Mut zu verlassen.
1958	"Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book on vegetable consumption: ""Veganerism – Animal-derived nutrients and their alternative"", explaining the many substances in food, but also detergents."

1959	"Every so often you take a look at the scanning table, knowing which letters and symbols are to check ""and sometimes it's better small steps to do than staying stationary or being stolen,"" says Proctor."	"Every time, after developing a scanning tool, you can see what to look for which marks and logos to watch ""It's sometimes better to be quick than not to stand still or to sign off"", according to Proctor."	"As soon as you are able to take a glance at Google and see what symbols and logos you're paying attention, remember the ""sometimes it's better to do little steps than to sit there or to steal"", says proctor."	"""Nach und nach entwickelt man einen Scannerblick und weiß, auf welche Zeichen und Logos man zu achten hat ""Es ist manchmal besser kleine Schritte zu tun als stehenzubleiben oder zu stolpern"", weiß Proctor."

Veganism is an important moral indicator which influences the mind and affects consciousness.	Der Veganismus, er ist ein wichtiger moralischer Fingerzeig, der auf das Bewusstsein schlägt.
1961	Perhaps he doesn't quite find it difficult to hide his habit, but at least he can convince the clients to question his habit as a whole.	Perhaps he doesn't quite get his way in to take down his habitation; at least he may convince the consumers to ask question about his habits.	Possibly he doesn't quite get rid of his habit; at least it can convince the consumer to ask his habit.	Vielleicht schafft er es nicht ganz, dass man seine Gewohnheiten ablegt, doch zumindest kann er den Konsumenten lehren, seine Gewohnheiten kritisch zu hinterfragen.
1962	Despite the first defeat of Bayern, the team was optimistically optimistic in the first half of the match.	Bayern Munich's basketball team in the first half of the defeat was optimistic.	Bayern's forward in spite of the defeat to the Blue team was pragmatic.	Bayerns Basketballer trotz erster Niederlage optimistisch
1963	Even the first defeat of the European League could never equalize the huge optimism that was at the head of the FC Bayern Munich basketball team.	Even after the first defeat in the European Cup, the enormous optimism exhibited by the U.S. basketball team Munich was not dissipated at all the time when the UCI basketball team were playing their home games.	Even the first defeat in the European League couldn't dampen the enormous optimism of the players at FC Bayern Munich even though they were aiming to win the competition.	Selbst die erste Niederlage in der Euroleague konnte bei den Basketballern des FC Bayern München den riesigen Optimismus nicht schmälern.
1964	"Nobody can convince us to think against the best team Europe has seen in recent years"", wrote Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) of Thursday night at the capital city's titleverter Olympiakos Piräus."	"No one can convince us to believe even against the best team Europa this past two years"", presiding over the miserable 83:88 (39:47) game on Donnerstag evening against the titleverteidiger Olympiakos Piräus."	"No one can prevent us believing in the best team Europa, even against the most renowned team for two past years,"" wrote Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after his poor score of 83:88 (39:47) on Tuesday night against the title rivals Olympiakos Piräus."

1966	While the echelons that they had spent their first three years in the European Union were well received in the early stages of the game, however they were not sufficiently resolved in the decisive phase.	The mints sold in the first phase of the European Union for long periods, but they weren't well known enough to finalize the final stages.	The monks who won their first European crown long ago did not have enough clues in the crucial phases.	Bei ihrem erst dritten Auftritt in der europäischen Königsklasse verkauften sich die Münchner lange sehr gut, waren in den entscheidenden Phasen aber einfach nicht abgeklärt genug.
1967	The guests at once created the masterpiece, an eight-ball-length dessert 13 minutes before ending in a tie, so after converting the game to a fist it was set to be a sword.	The guests first created the art piece, a fifteen-piece spread 13 minutes before final time in a game where, before leaving a curtain, another weapon was given to the game.	The guests subsequently made the artpiece of fifteen-pounds, ending with a final whistle. However, after a setback of seven minutes, the crowd again turned to the match's final whistle.	Die Gäste schafften zunächst das Kunststück, einen 15-Punkte-Rückstand 13 Minuten vor Schluss noch in eine Führung umzuwandeln, ehe Piräus dem Spiel erneut eine Wende gab.
1968	"We fought back a lukewarm fight during the second half of the European Cup, but then again made a light-hearted error,"" said the Bayern boss Yassin Idbihi."

2443	Humans who grew up knowing too much of the past century were fond of images of heaven and hell; thus, they interpreted the present day prophetic teachings of the hope for fullness by an inadequacy or inflection.

When the people of the past sat on too much knowledge and savoring images of heaven and hell who had so often become our understandings until today, so savorened the zeitgenöss prophetic predictions of the future in the form of a mere linguistic immanence were further encapsulated in the sense that human beings are ill-equipped for completeness than any hope of reaching full completion.	"Hätten die Menschen in den vergangenen Jahrhunderten davon zu viel gewusst und dabei auf jene Bilder von Himmel und Hölle gesetzt, ""die bis heute unsere Vorstellungen prägen"", so zeichne sich die zeitgenössische prophetische Lehre von den Hoffnungen auf Vollendung eher durch eine gewisse Verlegenheit oder gar Sprachlosigkeit aus."

2447	The only thing that could be done about that is to ask anyone who thinks that the end of the matter is good.

The fundamental rules of the Diocesan Council are not to be altered, and the parish council members are to have their corresponding arrangements made more or less satisfied.

2845	The budget deficit has been reduced in anticipation of the CGT rate, but remained silent for the abject fate of the Treasury Secretary, George Osborne, who decided to apply for the tax breakup of the Electoral Act 2012 to impose a stamp duty of up to 7% on apartment costs and annual fee for purchasers that no longer operate as an enterprise and not individual citizens.	The minister of finance has proposed cutting the CGT rate, but waiting only on the abatement of the European Court of Justice for the removal of the tax cut on flats in Budget 2012, which had cost up to 2% on the price of apartments and the annual fees for those who bought it as a company and not as individuals.	The MFTA has reduced the cost of capital gains taxes to a forecast of 4%.	Das Finanzministerium hat provisorisch die CGT-Maßnahme durchkalkuliert, wartet aber noch auf die abschließende Entscheidung von Schatzkanzler George Osborne, der im Haushalt 2012 eine Stempelsteuer in Höhe von 7 % auf Wohnungen verhängt hatte, die über zwei Millionen Pfund kosten sowie jährliche Gebühren für Käufer, die Wohnungen als Firma und nicht als Einzelpersonen halten.

Bereits jetzt übersteigen die Einnahmen aus der Stempelsteuer für Wohneigentum in den Bezirken Westminster und Kensington & Chelsea, die im Steuerjahr 2012/13 bei 708 Millionen Pfund lagen, die Erlöse für Nordirland, Wales, Schottland, den Nordosten, Nordwesten, Yorkshire und die Region Humber zusammengenommen.
2847	Even though the introduction of the Stamp Duty on high-priced housing and the introduction of the consequent laws which govern this are hardly any doubts that such properties are taxed to be expensive, the impact of the already heavily imposed local taxes is inconsiderate.	"Neither the taxation of highly expensive dwellings nor the introduction of its consequent legislative amendment can be held to be too low on quality real estate, not considering the impact of the altered local tax system."""	No matter the taxation of high-cost apartments and the introduction of the amendment to the law, it can be said that a premium housing tax is too low in comparison with the lower rate of income in the town's tax code.	"Cook sagte: „Nach den Erhöhungen bei der Stempelsteuer auf hochpreisige Wohnungen und der Einführung der damit verbundenen Gesetzgebung gegen ein Umgehen kann man schwerlich behaupten, hochwertige Immobilien seien zu niedrig besteuert, ungeachtet der Auswirkungen des veralteten Gemeindesteuersystems."""

"„Doch dieser Schritt könnte einige ausländische Investoren zurückhaltender machen, was den Kauf von Immobilien in London angeht, oder Eigentümer davon abhalten zu verkaufen"", fügte er hinzu."
2849	The highest prices of flats in the wealthy west of London, whose borders are infamous from Fulham to Wimbledon, have declined by an average rate of rent in the past year.	The best-of-the-five on the market for flats, the prevailing rent of between five and ten per cent in London's south-west neighbourhood, blighted by the demise of Fulham as well as Wimbledon last year, has declined by 18.5 %.	The best-of-the-behaved homes, whose price is between five and 10 percent of the market for flats in London, which runs from Fulham to Wimbledon, have fallen by a record amount of an annual return of 18.5 % last year.	Erstklassige Immobilien – die obersten fünf bis zehn Prozent des Wohnungsmarkts nach Preis – im wohlhabenden Londoner Südwestgürtel, der sich von Fulham bis Wimbledon erstreckt, haben sich um den Rekordwert von 11,8 % im letzten Jahr verteuert.
2850	The prices in Central London showed a steady year-on-year rise of nearly six percentage points, but their decline was mainly contributed to an uneven regional market, which across the southwestern region of the city witnessed a downward trend, as well as a survey by the Ministry for Justice and Industry.	"The prices in Central London were showing an annual growth of 6% per year, but was affected by an unevenly priced ""inside shop"" which, on the south-west side of the city, the northern and the eastern flanks (7,4 %) observed a downward trend; a study of the Savills showed a similar upward trend."	"Average annual growth of 6,6 % in Central London, but an onslender ""inside-shop"" caused an upward trend in the north and east of the town, as evidenced by an analysis of the statistics."	"Die Preise in Central London wiesen ein gleichmäßiges jährliches Wachstum von 5,6 % auf, wurden aber von einem aufstrebenden „Inlandsmarkt"" überschattet, auf dem der südwestliche Teil der Stadt, der Norden (7,4 %) und der Osten (6,5 %) einen Aufwärtstrend erlebten, so eine Untersuchung von Savills."

Auch wenn die SG Achim/Baden seit vier Spieltagen ohne Sieg ist, herrscht beim Handball-Oberligisten weiterhin gute Stimmung.
2852	Tomasz Malmon doesn't doubt about that at all.	Those aren't any doubts to Tomasz Malmon about those rules.	Tomasz Malmon can't doubt it.	Daran lässt Trainer Tomasz Malmon überhaupt keine Zweifel.
2853	Everyone is still highly motivated.	Everybody's still fully motivated in this regard.	Everyone is still motivated to do that.	Alle sind weiterhin voll motiviert bei der Sache.

2855	"I don't know much more why a victory like this can taste"", hopes Malmon for his team to achieve success in the VFL Fredenbeck II."	I don't remember how such a victory tastes, so the manager expects Malmon to deliver an impressive performance for his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II.	Now that I don't know much how to make such a victory, Paul is looking forward to seeing his team succeed in the VFL Fredenbeck II game.	"""Denn ich weiß ja schon gar nicht mehr, wie so ein Sieg schmeckt"", erwartet Malmon ein Erfolgserlebnis von seiner Mannschaft beim VfL Fredenbeck II."
2856	Even though the Drittliga reserve in Fredenbeck hasn't yet cut down any trees, a snag in the back yard warns of a lack of suitable plantings.	Despite the fact that the Drittliga reserve hasn't yet planted any trees, the mosquitoes in the area warn of the danger.	Even when the DREAM reserve on Fredenbeck has yet not cleared any trees, the hedgehog in the field warns the Zebra.	Auch wenn die Drittliga-Reserve aus Fredenbeck aktuell noch keine Bäume ausgerissen hat, hebt Malmon im Vorfeld warnend den Zeigefinger.
2857	A lot of players I already trained myself in the a-level have yet to develop their skills.	Many players still grew up in the A-Jugend.	Many players have yet to train themselves in the A-Jugend.	Viele Spieler habe ich selber noch in der A-Jugend trainiert.
2858	They're sure to be very motivated against their ex-coach.	They will surely be very motivated against their former coach by virtue of that.	She will certainly be very motivated in the case of their ex-coach.	Von daher werden sie gegen ihren Ex-Coach sicher ganz besonders motiviert sein.
2859	You have to wait to see whether the first team will be upset or not, he said.	"""It's not necessary to wait, whether it'll be another upset or not,"" he told the gamecoach."	"It's up to the first team to be seriously upset,"" said the SG-Coach."	"""Zudem gilt es abzuwarten, ob dann noch Verstärkung aus der Ersten dabei ist"", verdeutlicht der SG-Coach."
2860	To finally get back into the success story, the MLP should definitely steer its match up to last season.	To finally return to the winning side, the Malmon team in comparison with the previous three years must certainly strengthen.	To get back into the football final and to finally return to winning ways, the team that came before them must definitely steer away from the previous campaign.	Um endlich wieder in die Erfolgsspur zurückzukehren, muss sich das Malmon-Team im Vergleich zu den vergangenen Auftritten auf jeden Fall steigern.
2861	The whole thing happened in the deck of work and the final score was a massive one.	The whole deck work and the slashery ended in a rout of embarrassment.	The final result was a decisive factor in the deck work and in the game of numbers.	Vor allen Dingen in der Deckungsarbeit und beim Umschaltspiel haperte es zuletzt doch gewaltig.
2862	Likewise, the chance for winning must be finalized.	Even the odds need improving in the end.	Both the chauvinism and the monetary reward must be improved in all respects.	Auch die Chancenverwertung muss definitiv besser werden.
2863	That being said, I hope my players finally get their heads free during the short break.	Hence, I hope that my players finally got their heads liberated during the short break.	I hope that my players finally get their heads free while they pause in the small game.	Daher hoffe ich, dass meine Spieler während der kurzen Pause endlich den Kopf frei bekommen haben.

2876	The possible election was a deeply political mystery within the national campaign infrastructure in Chicago and at the Oval Office.	The political crisis of the 1980s was deeply rooted in urban politics within the Obama campaign infrastructure.	The political switch was a deeply ingrained mystery within the electoral campaign in Chicago and the White House.	Der potenzielle Wechsel war ein streng gehütetes Geheimnis innerhalb der Kampagneninfrastruktur in Chicago und im Oval Office.
2877	Almost half the senior advisers to president – including Daley, who headed the campaign for Obama's Jim Messina and the white house's current chief advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the expected change of mind.	Even a solitary of the president's closest advisers, such as Daley, the former campaign manager Obama, Jim Messina, and the former lead staff at the White House, David Axelrod and David Pluffe, knew about the proposed change.	Only half of the president's most influential advisors – Daley, who helped bring Obama to power when Jim Messina was in office, and the former White House spokesman David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew the fate of his change.	Nur ein halbes Dutzend der engsten Berater des Präsidenten – einschließlich Daley, dem früheren Kampagnenleiter Obamas, Jim Messina, und der früheren leitenden Berater des Weißen Hauses, David Axelrod und David Plouffe – wussten über den angedachten Wechsel Bescheid.
2878	"In ""Doomsday,"" it is claimed that both candidates have agreed to the top of the list of possible compromises, arguing even though they ""are equal in terms of their personal and financial relations"", ultimately a vote firmly against such a compromise was enacted after the data showed that the candidates for president Clinton did not stand a substantial improvement from the numbers."	"While it's claimed that the top of the pile was in fact Clinton, in spite of their ""entire, personal relationships"", eventually voted against an such clumsiness, after the data proved that no significant improvement would be achieved in the race for president Clinton."	"In ""Double Down"" is claimed to have accepted at the top end of the struggle, but in spite of their ""entire personal relationship"", ultimately it was decided against a shrug after which the data revealed that the candidate Clinton didn't ""potentially improve Obama's chances in the sense of right""."	"In „Double Down"" wird behauptet, Daley habe an der Spitze der Bemühungen gestanden, Biden trotz ihres „engen, persönlichen Verhältnisses"" auszutauschen, ehe man sich schließlich gegen einen solchen Schachzug entschied, nachdem die Daten zeigten, dass die Kandidatur Clintons „die Chancen Obamas nicht maßgeblich verbessern"" würde."
2879	In a meeting with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually approved replacing Biden by Clinton.	A friend of Martin confirmed that the government really decided to replace Biden by Clinton.	In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually agreed to bring in Bill Clinton.	In einem Interview mit Martin bestätigte Daley, dass die Regierung tatsächlich überlegt habe, Biden durch Clinton zu ersetzen.
2880	"""I discussed a whole variety of things that should be taken into consideration, and that was among them,"" explained the magazine's general policy."	"I gave a complete range of things that need to be considered, and this was one of them,"" said the magazine's contributor."	"""I mentioned a whole series of things I should consider, and that was one of them,"" explained the magazine's cover."	"„Ich äußerte eine ganze Reihe von Dingen, die man in Erwägung ziehen sollte, und das war eines davon"", erklärte Daley dem Magazin."
2881	"Remembering that the president had so many furious questions at that point, we were asked ""What do you want?"	"It's important to remember that the president had so much fury when he was asked a question at the time. ""What do we want?"""	"In remembering the fact that the president was frightened to ask such questions, we were instructed to ask: ""What's God’s will we do?"""	"Man muss sich in Erinnerung rufen, dass der Präsident damals furchtbare Umfragewerte hatte, also dachten wir: „Um Gottes Willen, was machen wir?"""
2882	"At the same time, describing the investigations as ""disposalable"" said Martin at Anderson Cooper's of CNN that considerable expense was expended in the campaign for the election to find whether an election train would pay in advance."	"While the research dubbed ""gebotene horror"" during The campaign for the election was much more expensive than it would have occurred if there were any ballot boxes that reflected on the ballot box."	"While dreaded the term ""gebotene suffrage,"" according to Martin at Anderson Cooper's CNN, ""a lot of effort was exerted while the campaign for the election were in order to find out whether a train had made an accurate estimate on the ballot box""."	"Während Daley die Untersuchungen als „gebotene Sorgfalt"" bezeichnete, sagte Martin gegenüber Anderson Cooper von CNN, dass während der Kampagne für die Wiederwahl erheblicher Aufwand betrieben worden sei, um herauszufinden, ob ein solcher Zug sich im Hinblick auf die Wahlurnen auszahle."
2883	"In campaigns it won't be as much money to ask questions and focus groups unless you think seriously about something,"" explained Martin on AC360."	"In campaigns, it isn't so much money given to asking for questions and focusing groups if you don't really think about anything,"" said Martin on AC360."	"Campaigns will not give so much money to ask questions or focus groups if you don't think about it seriously,"" explained John on AC360."	"„In Kampagnen wird nicht so viel Geld für Umfragen und Fokusgruppen ausgegeben, wenn man nicht ernsthaft über etwas nachdenkt"", erklärte Martin auf AC360."
2884	It is unclear to which side of Obama knew that his team was planning on doing an exchange.	It's not clear whether Obama knew that his team was discussing an exchange.	It isn't clear to us whether Obama knew that his team was discussing an exchange.	Es ist allerdings nicht klar, ob Obama wusste, dass sein Team über einen Austausch nachdachte.
2885	Martin told CNBC that he wondered whether his damian boss had known the potent change.	Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley whether his damian boss knew the potent matter.	Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his damian boss had known the potent matter.	Martin sagte gegenüber CNN, er habe Daley gefragt, ob sein damaliger Boss über den potenziellen Wechsel Bescheid gewusst hätte.
2886	"While Daley said he didn't think that the president of any possible change ""was aware"", the previous chairman admitted it may have been ""possibly"" that Obama knew about it."	"Even though Daley explained that he did not think the president of any change ""knew"" but the old tabloid reported that he knew Obama could be changing."	"Even though Daley explained that he didn't think that the president of any possible change ""was aware"" the former cabinet member suggested it could have happened."	"Wenngleich Daley erklärte, er glaube nicht, dass sich der Präsident der möglichen Veränderung „bewusst war"", gab der frühere Stabschef zu, es sei „möglich"" gewesen, dass Obama davon gewusst habe."
2887	Martin added that he didn't have the definitive answer to the question whether the political negotiations under Obama had finally arrived.	Martin said that he didn't think there was a definitive answer to the question whether the political negotiations on the table at the White House had ended in favor of Obama.	"Martin added that “double down"" wouldn't be a definitive answer to how much the political divisions in Obama's cabinet would have been reached were political."	"Martin fügte hinzu, dass „Double Down"" keine definitive Antwort auf die Frage liefere, ob die politischen Sondierungen Obamas Schreibtisch erreicht hätten."
2888	Cooper asked Martin whether he thought that he really thought Obama knew nothing from the investigation about whether it should be allowed to vote against Biden.	Cooper asked Martin if he really thought that Obama did not know from the investigation whether it should be allowed to vote.	Cooper asked Martin whether he really thought that Obama knew nothing about the investigation into whether candidate candidates should be dropped at the election.	Cooper fragte Martin, ob er ernsthaft denke, Obama habe nichts von den Untersuchungen darüber gewusst, ob man Biden bei den Wahlen fallen lassen solle.
2889	It would be nice for him to say that.	Certainly, said Martin.	Definitely! he said to Martin.	"„Möglich"", erwiderte Martin."
2890	The council enjoys a solid budget.	The council enjoys a sound budget.	The Commune is happy with the solid budget.	Gemeinderat freut sich über soliden Haushalt
2891	When it is decided on local council members how to raise the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerber laughs well.	When councillors decide over the budget, Governor Ralph Gerster laughs well.	Every time there is a vote on municipal budgets, Ralph Gerster laughs really well.	Immer wenn es in Gemeinderatssitzungen um den Haushalt geht, hat Bürgermeister Ralph Gerster gut lachen.
2892	The local grocery in Herdwicken-Schoek is well stocked, and the parish office has not been open since 2005.	The village's cupboard in Herdwangen-Schoek is well stocked and the management hasn't been aware of it since 2005.	The council box in Herdwangen-Schönach is well stocked and the head office has not been updated since 2005.	Das Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach ist gut gefüllt und Schulden kennt die Verwaltung bereits seit 2005 nicht mehr.
2893	Even the fiscal year 2012 can be described as a full success.	Even the budget year 2012 can be described as a complete success in that sense.	Even the budget year 2012 can be judged to have been a complete success in that regard.	Auch das Haushaltsjahr 2012 kann in diesem Sinne als voller Erfolg verbucht werden.
2894	This was clearly revealed when the year-end statement for 2012 was presented.	This was clear at the beginning of the year 2012 report.	This was evident at the end of the year reconciliation.	Dies wurde bei der Vorstellung der Jahresrechnung für 2012 deutlich.
2895	As Andrea Rothmund explained, the cost of living in the administrative budget was about 1.6 million euros higher than originally planned.	Andrea Rothmund explained how the budget for the office was about 6.7 million euros higher than originally envisaged.	As Andrea Rothmund explained that the budget for a management office was cut by about 6,6 million euros.	Wie Andrea Rothmund erläuterte, sei der Verwaltungshaushalt mit rund 7,6 Millionen Euro über eine Millionen Euro höher ausgefallen als geplant.
2896	Even the cost of the administration budget increased by about eight million euros against the budget.	Even the overhead of the budget deficit was about one million euros more generous than the budget.	Even the cost of the budget deficit came to about one million euros over the budget.	Auch der Überschuss des Verwaltungshaushaltes liege mit etwa 1,8 Millionen Euro rund eine Millionen Euro über dem Ansatz.
2897	The addition of the above-mentioned income tax and the levy on the village income tax are to greatly benefit from the higher rate of pay.	The overreconciliation of the income tax and the council tax increase were welcome.	Lastly, the excise tax has gone up significantly, in particular on higher incomes from the locality.	Zu verdanken sei der Überschuss vor allem höheren Gewerbesteuereinnahmen und dem Gemeindeanteil an der Einkommenssteuer.
2898	The wealth balance again stood significantly above the planned value.	Even the capital balance was well over the forecast.	The net worth of the assets was also significantly less than planned.	Auch der Vermögenshaushalt lag wieder deutlich über den geplanten Werten.
2899	Stats of the planned one million euros compared with the previous year's 2,5 million euros.	The planned 1.5 million euros cost 2.6 million euros last year.	According to the planned 1.5 million euros, last year he was carrying out the necessary 2.5 million euros.	Statt der vorgesehenen 1,5 Millionen Euro betrug er im vergangenen Jahr 2,5 Millionen Euro.
2900	In this sense it's the result of the higher budget at the end of the management tier, as the Rothmund said.	This is related in a way to the higher income from the administration, so Rothmund said.	It is, in fact, a question of how much the budget goes from the state budget to the budget.	"""Dies liegt im Wesentlichen an der höheren Zuführung aus dem Verwaltungshaushalt"", so Rothmund."
2901	Since less than planned for the budget year 2012 were invested in the period 2012, results from the redrafts' implementation are higher.	Since less investment was made in the budget year 2012 than originally planned, the cost of carrying out checks is also higher.	In the budget year 2012 there were less than originally planned investments, thus the costs of carrying out redress are higher.	Da im Haushaltsjahr 2012 weniger Investitionen als geplant getätigt worden sind, ist auch die Rücklagenzuführung höher ausgefallen.
2902	The total return could be increased from around 2.1 million euros to about 4,9 millions euro now.	Overall, the general ratio was lowered from about 2 million Euro to nearly four million Euro.	Total demand was forecast to reach around 2.1 million euro, while the total budget was now at 4,9 millions euros.	Insgesamt konnte die allgemeine Rücklage um rund 2,1 Millionen Euro auf jetzt insgesamt 4,9 Millionen Euro gesteigert werden.
2903	Ralph Gershmund praised Rothmund and his team for the good work.	Mayor Ralph Gerst praised Rothmund and their team for their good work.	Tom Gerrard thanked Rothmund and his team for their good work.	Bürgermeister Ralph Gerster bedankte sich bei Rothmund und ihrem Team für die gute Arbeit.
2904	"A book isn't easy to make out of the box"", praised Gerst with a glance at the financial bill."	"""A work is not easy to build up in the mud"" praised Gerster with an eye on the financial statement."	"""However, a work is not just thrown into the barrel"", exhorted Gerster with a glance at the financial report."	"""So ein Werk schüttelt man nicht einfach aus dem Ärmel"", lobte Gerster mit Blick auf die Jahresrechnung."
2905	He and the village council were looking pleased by the good numbers.	He and the council were glad to be in this good position.	He and the council members were surprised by the good numbers.	Er und die Gemeinderäte freuten sich sichtlich über die guten Zahlen.
2906	It seems paradox to me, but if these good figures come easily to the public soon.	It seems paradoxical, but just these good numbers may soon be costly to the taxpayers.	It might seem paradoxical, but just these good numbers could soon cost the people dear.	Es mag paradox klingen, doch genau diese guten Zahlen könnten die Bürger bald teuer zu stehen kommen.
2907	In the past, because the finances were well-run, the village could have saved up a large inheritance.	The community could have avoided rising taxes due to the good finances.	The church was able to save a large amount of money through the good budget in the past.	Durch die gute Finanzlage konnte die Gemeinde in der Vergangenheit auf hohe Hebesätze verzichten.
2908	Having returned to the land after that, many farmers have already been forced to chop up zucchini from the country.	That's why many farmers have fallen off their land for the time being.	This time, many farmers have had to take refuge in the country before they were able to do that.	Dadurch wiederum seien aber laut Gerster schon öfters Zuschüsse vom Land gekürzt worden.
2909	There are different levels of adsorption for these Zuschüsse made up of various types of timber.	There are conditions for these desserts made up of diverse sets of cubes.	These doughnuts from different sizes and shapes have a set of conditions.	Für diese Zuschüsse aus diversen Ausgleichsstöcken gibt es Voraussetzungen.
2910	Among the municipalities and towns beaning the concessions have to apply certain provisions.	Among the towns and villages which accept Zushüsse, they should demonstrate certain norms.	Among the cities and communes applying for Zuschüsse must also demonstrate certain provisions.	Unter anderem müssen die Städte und Gemeinden, die Zuschüsse beantragen, bestimmte Hebesätze vorweisen.
2911	"""The topic of poverty must be considered since in the next few years we'd like to invest in things which we could have liked more than that,"" said a Gershtin in this connection."	"The subject of wages must be looked upon as we move forward because, in the future, there will be investments that we'd like to buy again,"" said a Gerson in this respect."	"The subject of poverty is to look at it, since a number of investments are required in the coming years for which we'd like to have some comforts,"" said Gerber in that respect."	"""Das Thema Hebesätze müssen wir uns anschauen, da in den kommenden Jahren Investitionen anstehen, für die wir gerne Zuschüsse hätten"", kündigte Gerster in diesem Zusammenhang an."

2915	Through the emphasizing of firmaments, young people expressed their respect for their duty and embodied the force of the Holy Spirit.	With the enactment of firmaments they said yes to their duties and poured out the force of holy acts.	As part of The Emphasis on Firm adverbs, the youths were apt to their own tasks.	Mit dem Empfang des Firmsakraments sagten die Jugendlichen Ja zu ihrer Taufe und erbaten die Kraft des Heiligen Geistes.
2916	The Firmlings were formed during the past few months, headed by Dr. Daniel Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous community members on the large festive day.

When I finish my patient diary and bedside sleep, the book takes me back to a night when politics were so infected that it had the ability to read and discuss the subject.

2933	Restarting the surroundings is a bad awakening as one gets caught up in a trauma.	Resuming your clock in the opposite direction is a bad sign when one is caught out of a nightmare.	A repeat of the same scenario is a wicked awakening, as if it is a dream.	Wieder umzuschalten auf die Gegenwart ist ein böses Erwachen, als ob man aus einem Traum gerissen wird.
2934	It's hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem a vague memory, a regrettable reminder of the past.	It is hard to remember these optimist periods - they seem a bleak memory, a sad reminder that there's no time for wasted.	It's hard to remember the optimistic times: they seem a jarring memory, a sad reminder to an age when there are no options.	Es fällt schwer, sich an diese optimistischen Zeiten zu erinnern – sie scheinen eine vage Erinnerung zu sein, eine traurige Mahnung an verpasste Möglichkeiten.
2935	During the years that I've first gave up my voice, something really changed.	The years since I first gave up my vote have changed really something.

2937	I know the wide range of things Obama has accomplished, from the enactment of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of the United States as a military force, the end of the widespread repression of homosexuality in the army and Osamu’s murder.	I understand the great, diverse things Obama achieved from the establishment of the Affordable Care Act to the military withdrawal of the Iraq War, the end abruptly of the armed forces' adoption of homosexuality in the army and the death of Osama.	I realize the great and diversified things Obama achieved through the repeal of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance, the end of the alleged exclusion of homosexuality in the army, and the death of Osama.

2938	In addition, I think that a political and economic block has led to too many reforms which our nation should implement: constitutional amendments, an open option for health insurance and the ban on Guantanamo Bay, among others.	I also think the partisan politics of the communist movement contributed to too many disasters to bring about further harm than the reform of our nation, including the creation of an open option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, but not to name a few.	I think that the partisan politics of blockade have led to too many acts against our country before: the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the repeal of the American Red Cross and the closing of Guantanamo Bay; just a few.	Auch ich bin der Ansicht, dass die parteipolitische Blockadetaktik zu viele Bestrebungen gekippt habe, mit denen unsere Nation vorwärts gebracht werden sollte: Einwanderungsreform, eine öffentliche Option für Krankenversicherung und das Schließen von Guantanamo Bay, um nur einige zu nennen.
2939	But after he defended the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances for the first time, I came to an end with my explanation attempt.	However, after nearly seven hundred arguments against the Obama administration in favor of peers and knowns I came to an end with my attempt at explanation.

Doch nachdem ich zahllose Male die Obama-Regierung gegenüber Kollegen und Bekannten verteidigt habe, bin ich mit meinen Erklärungsversuchen am Ende angelangt.
2940	I reached a point of political dislocation.	I reached a point of political discord.	I reached a point of political disgraceful.	Ich habe einen Punkt politischer Verzweiflung erreicht.
2941	The republican blocade cannot explain why the abduction of foreign parliamentarians or the execution of innocent children by poisoning cannot be explained.	The republican blockade is insinuating that the abolition of foreign parliamentarians and the killing of innocent children who are murdered by draughtsmen by the Nazis.	The republican blockade policy cannot explain why the abhorrent sexism against foreigners or the murder of innocent children by intoxication is justified.	Die republikanische Blockadepolitik kann nicht erklären, weshalb man das Abhören ausländischer Staatsoberhäupter zulässt oder die Tötung unschuldiger Kinder durch Drohnen in Übersee.
2942	It cannot be explained why the National Security Agency has collected private information about American citizens and why whistleblowers are being accused of misconduct by the government.	It can't be explained why the National Security Agency gathers data about the private life of Americans and why whistleblowers are being investigated for their misbehaving.	It cannot be explained why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why whistleblowers are being urged to act in public misconduct.	Es kann nicht erklären, weshalb die National Security Agency Daten über das Privatleben von Amerikanern sammelt und warum Whistleblower bestraft werden, die staatliches Fehlverhalten offenlegen.
2943	It is not possible to explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American national, was murdered without trial, or why the public finances and expenditure limits were raised during the Presidential elections.	It cannot be explained why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-American citizen, was murdered without prosecution nor why the state finance and expenditure limit for president election campaigns is set at once.	The reason why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-American national accused of murder without trial can't explain how budget and expenditure limits for the presidency are being increased.	Es kann nicht erklären, weshalb Anwar al-Awlaki, ein US-amerikanischer Staatsbürger, ohne Verfahren ermordet wurde, noch weshalb die öffentlichen Finanzierungs- und Ausgabegrenzen während der Präsidentschaftswahlen umgangen werden.
2944	"The results of a report is not quite perfect, in short, the efforts of the White House to influence the media are the most ""progressive..."" since the Nixon regime."	"The results of an article do not sound fair; in other words, the efforts made by white houses to influence the media were ""the most violent... since the Nixon government."""	"The results of a report are not right, but in the same manner the efforts of the white house to influence media was the most violent since the Nixon regime."""	"Es rechtfertigt nicht die Ergebnisse eines Berichts, in dem es heißt, die Anstrengungen des Weißen Hauses zur Ruhigstellung der Medien seien die „aggressivsten ... seit der Nixon-Regierung""."
2945	And even recently, the inability to send out a simple website has not diminished any time since the Affordable Care Act was signed.	And younger people can't afford the lack of accessibility — for three years since the Affordable Care Act was signed.	Even a younger person cannot forgive the inability to put up with more than three years since the repeal of the Affordable Care Act to create a simple website.	Und jüngstens kann es nicht die Unfähigkeit entschuldigen, in den mehr als drei Jahren seit der Verabschiedung des Affordable Care Act eine einfache Website zu entwerfen.
2946	I don't know whether this is what I expected.	I do not know if it's what I expected.	I don't know if this is what I should have expected.	Ich weiß nicht, ob es das ist, was ich hätte erwarten sollen.
2947	No matter my age at 18, I should have understood that the government's work on her ambitious political campaign could be further spread.	I should've understood by now that the government working on their proposals could have spread more widely.	I should've understood by the age of 18 how government work could have pushed for her ambitious political campaigns.	Ob ich mit 18 hätte verstehen sollen, dass die Regierungsarbeit den ihr vorangehenden politischen Kampagnen widersprechen könnte.
2948	Clearly, the aboriginal assembly does not follow its predictable course, while an opposition party and other public events such as the Newtown Massacre are subject to public debate.	Generally speaking, the coalition is not in a pre-eminent course; an opposition party and subsequent events such as The Boston Marathon are topics of public debate.	On occasion the committee's course is not predictable; an opposition bloc and unexpected events, such as the Newtown Massacre, are the subject of public debate.	Offensichtlich ist das Abgeordnetenamt kein vorhersehbarer Kurs, da eine Oppositionspartei und zufällige Ereignisse wie das Newtown-Massaker die öffentliche Diskussion prägen.
2949	But when I look at the above mentioned examples, they seem far from being voted on by the government as such.	However, when I look at the above mentioned examples, they seem to be much closer than the government themselves.	But when I look at the above-mentioned examples, they seem far from being elected by the government themselves.	Doch wenn ich mir die oben genannten Beispiele ansehe, dann scheinen sie weitgehend von der Regierung selbst gewählt zu sein.
2950	And that bothers me the most.	And that bothers me more than anything.	And that annoys me the most.	Und das stört mich am meisten.
2951	I was again elected to the election of Obama in 2012, not because i was so enthusiastic about his candidacy.	I was elected again as president in 2012, not because I was thrilled with his election.	2012 was the third time that I elected Obama, but not because my enthusiasm for his candidacy was high.	Ich habe 2012 wieder Obama gewählt, nicht weil ich über seine Kandidatur begeistert war.
2952	With Romney casting a confusing and unattainable alternative, he couldn't pin point his direction and position.	Mitt Romney presented a confusing and inexcusable alternative; he couldn't decide his direction and position.	Mitt Romney offered a confusing and inseparable alternative, so he couldn't make his direction and position clear.	Mitt Romney stellte eine verwirrende und unausgegorene Alternative dar, er schien seine Richtung und Positionen nicht festlegen zu können.
2953	I thought that another election for Obama, free from pressure on future candidates, would fulfill the hope we'd heard so long.	I had the impression that a second term for President, free from pressure on future elections, would fulfil the hopes we'd been hearing so long.	I felt like a second term for Obama, free from pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard so long.	Ich hatte den Eindruck, eine zweite Amtszeit für Obama, frei vom Druck künftiger Wahlen, würde die Hoffnung erfüllen, von der wir schon so lange gehört hatten.
2954	Despite the sinking of the presidential vote on less than 45 % this week, the return to 2008 from this book has been so harrowing.	But with the decline of the approval rating for Obama falling below 45 % this week, the return in 2008 to what was once considered a record high as result of this book has grown so pronounced.	But when it is set at under 45 % this week, the returns of this book to 2008 have been so alarming.	Doch mit dem Sinken der Zustimmungswerte für Obama auf unter 45 % diese Woche ist die Rückkehr ins Jahr 2008 durch dieses Buch um so härter geworden.
2955	The look in my mind is awe-inspiring as the great promise that has been made in the air.	The smell in my head is the smell of a large number of promises being made that have come into being in the air.	All of a sudden in me the search for the many promises that have turned into air.	Es weckt in mir die Sehnsucht nach den vielen Versprechen, die sich in Luft aufgelöst haben.
2956	This week, I read an excerpt of the book that describes Obama's decision to cancel the election in Pennsylvania when it was a heavy loss to Clinton in the race for the presidency.	This week, I am reading a chapter in the book that describes how Obama had to cancel a severe defeat against Clinton in the election of 2015 in Pennsylvania.	This week, I am reading an excerpt from the book that chronicles how President had to put up with a serious loss against Clinton in the election campaign in Pennsylvania.	Diese Woche las ich einen Abschnitt in dem Buch, der beschreibt, wie Obama einen schweren Verlust gegen Clinton bei den Vorwahlen in Pennsylvania einstecken musste.
2957	A meeting with the Election Commission after the vote said that he'd tell his employees to come back on track, and the purpose of their job should be met.	At a meeting with the election television after the decision he told his employees to go back on track and see what they were meant to be doing.	During an interview with the electoral committee on the day after the decision he told his employees they were supposed to get back on track and understand the purpose of their decision.	In einem Treffen mit den Wahlhelfern nach der Entscheidung sagte er seinen Mitarbeitern, sie müssten zurück auf Kurs kommen und dem Zweck ihrer Sache folgen.
2958	I'd like to return our magic, he said.	I'd like to find back our magical spell, he said.	I would like to find our magic again, he said.	"„Ich möchte, dass wir unseren Zauber wiederfinden"", sagte er."
2959	We need to remember who we are.	We must remember who we are.	We must remember who we are.	Wir müssen uns daran erinnern, wer wir sind.
2960	Y'all are five years after, then, Mr. President, and I cannot agree with you more strongly than I have been on my previous ones.	Five years later, Mr President, and I cannot agree with you any more.	Five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you any more.	Es sind fünf Jahre später, Mr. President, und ich könnte Ihnen nicht stärker zustimmen.

2964	Short before the circle of town he noticed that he parked on the linky lanes at the direction of Stromeyersdorf Road, changing to the right.	Shortly before the roundabout he noticed that he turned in to the right side of the road in the direction of Stromeyersdorf Street and crossed into the right.	Shortly before the cycle track to the city centre, he noticed that he was heading along the Greenway, heading towards St. Mary's Square and switching on the left side of the street.

2965	It came to a collision with the BMW there, which was reportedly a 23-year-old car.	Here came a collision with the then 23-year-old concertival BMW.	There came the collision with the there driven BMW 23-year-old Continental Continental.	Hierbei kam es zum Zusammenstoß mit dem dort fahrenden BMW eines 23-jährigen Konstanzers.
2966	The passenger behind the BMW was likely to be a 19-year old.	A 19-year-old may have been responsible for the accident behind the BMW.	Perhaps the driver behind the BMW drove a 19-year old.	Ebenfalls beschädigt wurde der hinter dem BMW fahrende VW Passat eines 19-Jährigen.

2968	The roadblock was smashed during the accident. Therefore, it continued to be strewn up at the scene of the accident.	The motorway had to be closed during the crash, so the rest of the traffic could not.	The roadside queue had to be kept up during the collision, so the escalator ran on in.	Die Fahrbahn musste während der Unfallaufnahme gesperrt werden, hieß es weiter.
2969	The power in Pfullendorf gets more expensive.	The electricity in hollowholes is getting more expensive.	In Plumwood, the electricity gets more costly.	In Pfullendorf wird der Strom teurer
2970	The citizens of Pfullendorf have to pay more attention toward electricity costs.	The citizens in favour of higher electricity bills have to adjust themselves to lower electricity costs.	The citizens of Pfullendorf have to settle for higher electricity prices.	Die Bürger Pfullendorfs müssen sich auf höhere Stromkosten einstellen.
2971	As the city manager of Jörg-Arne Bias confirmed against the SÜDKER, families who own four beds will pay between 70 and 90 euros a year.	As per the town council, Jörg-Arne Bélas confirmed against SÜDKURIER, four families – each with a salary of €45,000 – are going on a four-room flat.	According to the city manager Jörg-Arne Bias, who confirmed the SÜDRUMENT, four families of four can cost between 90 and 94 euros a year.	Wie der Geschäftsführer der Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, gegenüber dem SÜDKURIER bestätigte, kommen auf eine vierköpfige Pfullendorfer Familie 70 bis 90 Euro Mehrkosten pro Jahr zu.
2972	The main reason for the price hike is that the cost of such a measure of electricity rose by as much as 277 euros per kW.	Wesenty reason for the current price hike is the increase in the so-called eEG conversion rate from 2,275 to 6,3 cent per kilogram of electricity, which is an important factor in the price rise.	An equally important factor in the proposed price hike is the rise of the so-called average EEG-Umlage from 5,277 to 6,3 cent per watt hour.	Wesentlicher Grund der anstehenden Preiserhöhung ist der Anstieg der sogenannten EEG-Umlage von 5,277 auf 6,3 Cent pro Kilowattstunde.
2973	This design is chosen every year at the end of October by four operators of the big electricity distribution network.	All in October, these amendments are inserted into the revised version of this agreement from four operators of the large grid.	The agreement on the large electricity bill is negotiated each year in October by all four operators of these large transmission networks.	Diese Umlage wird jedes Jahr im Oktober von den vier Betreibern der der großen Stromtrassen neu festgesetzt.
2974	These recoup the cost of electricity due to the use of renewable energy, which they can reduce through a discount on the price of electricity.	These offset the increased cost of running electricity from the energy use, which can be offset by a hike in the price of electricity.	These scuppered the energy cost to them from the increased costs of electricity that they could save by lowering their utility bill.	Diese beziffern die ihnen aus der Energiewende entstehenden Mehrkosten, die sie durch eine Umlage über den Strompreis erheben können.
2975	The town's pillars form the last gable on this chain.	The town's pavement tiles form the final piece of the puzzle.	The town halls Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.	Die Stadtwerke Pfullendorf bilden das letzte Glied in dieser Kette.
2976	The chairman of the energy company forecast a lower cost, according to Jörg-Arne Bias.	The energy commission ruled that its projections had been slightly higher than the estimates from Jörg-Arne Bias.	The chairman of the energy company predicted a higher price as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.	Der Aufsichtsrat des Energieunternehmens war in seinen Prognosen sogar von einer höheren Umlage ausgegangen, wie Jörg-Arne Bias berichtet.
2977	Now the real cost must be calculated before the town offices can inform their customers about the actual price increase next week.	The specific costs need to be computed so that the cities' council can inform their customers about the actual price hike next week.	Now the actual costs must be figured out before the town councils are able to inform their customers about the exact cost of living next week.	Nun müssten die konkreten zahlen errechnet werden, bevor die Stadtwerke nächste Woche ihre Kunden über die exakte Preiserhöhung informieren könnten.
2978	"""We're moving from a weight of 1 cent to 4 cents"", as in Bias, where the number will be nearer than 2 cents."	We are going from a cost of one cent to one cent, so the figure is bound to be about two cents.	"""We are going from 1 cent to two cents,"" a figure which will remain the same until far in the future."	"""Wir gehen von einer Anhebung von 1 Cent plus x aus"", so Bias, wobei die Zahl eher in der Nähe der 2 Cent liegen werde."
2979	Josef Winkler has been writing his diary for over thirty years describing his childhood and youth from the lakeside.	Josef Winkler has written about his childhood and young days from the lake.

2980	His catastrophic cult of his own human civilization — the languagelessness, the tendency to violence and sexual indescribability — are described by the harsh poets as many times.	The tragedies of his katholic village people - the lack of language, the desire to violence and deafening sexuality, the Enge and Freudlessness - the writer-scribe described their hero as he described it many times.	"The katastrophes described in his own literary heritage, the lack of language, the desire to violence and a hostility towards sexuality, the fear of failure and insecurity, described by the writer for the poem ""Cruising Poetry"" many times."	Die Katastrophen seiner katholischen Dorfkindheit - die Sprachlosigkeit, der Hang zu roher Gewalt und stumpfer Sexualität, die Enge und Freudlosigkeit - hat der Kärntner Dichter vielfach beschrieben.
2981	Known for the Büchner pre-mix and the syllable orchestral, the plays are rare in Shakespeare's works.	Although the tin can be used to represent stage actors in his work, theatre texts are rare in his work.	Although the standard prelude is well known as a productionist, the text of his play is rare.	Bekannt ist der Büchner-Preisträger vor allem als Prosaautor, Theatertexte sind in seinem Werk rar.
2982	"The compilation of prosaic texts by Gerhard Fresacher makes for his presentation ""The downward spiral of the staircase"", now visible at garage X on Petersplatz, hence being compiled from prosaic texts."	"The exhibition of works by prosaic artists Gerhard Fresnor has a series of poems from the same theme to see on the podium at his performance ""The changing landscape of the garage X on the Petersplatz"", therefore drawing on the themes of earlier works by prosaic artists."	"Adaptation of prosaic texts Gerhard Fresacher's for his installation ""Wetterlights on the tip of the fence now in Garage X on the Peterborough street"" therefore a prosaic text collection is adapted from prosaic texts."	"Collage aus Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher stellt für seine Aufführung ""Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze"", die nun in der Garage X am Petersplatz zu sehen ist, daher eine Collage aus Prosatexten zusammen."
2983	"The theater director fuses elements from the autobiographically-inspired novel ""The Death of the Leiberians"" (1987) with prosaic pieces from ""The Living and the Abundant Life of the Man"" (1999)."

"Der Theatermacher verbindet etwa Elemente aus dem autobiografisch geprägten Roman ""Der Leibeigene"" (1987) mit Prosaminiaturen aus ""Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd"" (2003)."
2984	On the stage where the stage had been largely empty is an important requirement, a ten-seat ensemble which is constructed from the textual material and then refashioned into a coherent piece.	Located on the stage far gone are some very important requirements: a compact sofa, which is often copied and hung through the text to create the eight-string ensemble.	A large scale rehearsal – an enormous set of tables, which is carefully curated and arranged to be performed – is hanging in the orchestral hall, covered with the text material across the wide stage.	Auf der weitgehend leergeräumten Bühne - wichtiges Requisit: ein zerknautschtes Sofa, auf dem andeutungsweise kopuliert und masturbiert wird - hangelt sich das achtköpfige Ensemble durch das Textmaterial.
2985	Likewise, the novel appears to be a bit of a pity for critics.	This is hardly a reliable rule in which Regency Regulators are willing to believe the text.	This author seems to be a nutter of the text, so much so that he seems to trust the script.	Dabei scheint Regisseur Fresacher dem Text wenig zu vertrauen.
2986	The 70-minute performance is a cross-over the stage, with a fillet of historical passages from the play's repertoire.	The performance of the 70 minutes comprises the text by adding a full body of theatre scenes known from the Repertory of Plays Against The Walls.	The production overturns the script with a rich selection of scenes associated with period drama, known from the repertory post-Dramatic theatre.	Die 70-minütige Performance übertüncht die Vorlage mit einer Fülle an Regieeinfällen, bekannt aus dem Repertoire postdramatischer Spielformen.
2987	The actor's come to the brim with rather bad zen-style performances.	All the actor's coming to terms with something very strange szentan translations are being done in.	Amongst the actors, they usually end up in quite the opposite way in somewhat strange szenitic situations.	Vor allem die Schauspielerinnen kommen bei den mitunter etwas fragwürdigen szenischen Umsetzungen dran.
2988	They're rough bitten: covered with water, painted with their evening rituals on the wall.	You've been hammered hard, covered with water and stuffed with her favs.	Their heads were soaked with water, and their evening gowns decorated with flowers on the wall.	Sie werden hart angefasst, mit dem Kopf unter Wasser getaucht, mit ihren Abendroben an die Wand getackert.
2989	Eingested in cellophan or gel, stashed on dangerously high shelves by the lighting, either monologize them louder than usual or lie completely stutter at the stage.	Eingested in either cellulose or silk fibre, stabbing on dangerously high pedestals by the animation, they either monologize loudly over the stage floor or lay totally buried on the stage.	They grow into vultures in cellulose or molecular matter; either monologize them loudly on the stage floor, or they sit completely dead on the dance floor.	Eingezwängt in Zellophan oder Mieder, staksen sie auf gefährlich hohen Stöckeln durch die Inszenierung, entweder monologisieren sie lautstark oder liegen völlig verstummt auf dem Bühnenboden.
2990	The text, although very effective, barely conveys itself in this manner.	The text, though hardly any one can convey its meaning on this sensitive subject.	The text hardly conveys itself in this highly stylized fashion.	Der Text vermittelt sich auf diese angestrengte Weise jedoch kaum.
2991	The better part of the evening is singing - the band's range ranges from Deep Purple to poplar.	The best moments of the evening are when singing is possible. The band width ranges from deep purple to almost all-night.	A great evening is one when music is played - the range of colors ranges from deep purple to voluptuous.	Die besten Momente hat der Abend, wenn gesungen wird - die Bandbreite reicht von Deep Purple bis zu volkstümlichem Liedgut.
2992	At the end of the overriding story comes to a halt, while the overtaken performance suddenly fades into tranquility, and Winkler's absurd absurdity is burst forth into laughter.	The overwrought production is coming to a stop before the inevitable end, and Winkler's hilarious absurdity burst forth.	The over-told tale reaches a halt, the overture being turned slightly absurd, and the slapstick comedy is bursting out.	Erst gegen Ende kommt die überdrehte Aufführung etwas zur Ruhe, und Winklers nachgerade absurder Humor blitzt auf.

2994	The chances of remaining in the League Cup for the league that was formerly the athletically abstained Ludwigsburger B-Boarder had an increase.	The chances of remaining in the Bundesliga — an uphill battle for the sportfully abled Ludwigsburger BVB team — are increased.	The chances of the League Cup survival of the sport-abundered Ludwigsburger Blastball team are increased.	Die Chancen auf den Ligaverbleib der sportlich abgestiegenen Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballer sind gestiegen.
2995	Since it is supposed to be a wildcard run, there are now fewer than two carryovers for the Neckar Rieslings.	Because it should be possible to drive a Wildcard, so there are less drivers now for the Northern Rings.	Since it should be a wildcard drive, then there would be fewer drivers for the northern hemisphere.	Denn sollte es ein Wildcard-Verfahren geben, dann gibt es für die Neckar Riesen nun einen Mitbewerber weniger.
2996	The Hamburg Basketball Team has announced plans for a possible replacement.	The Hamburg Basketball project has accepted a possible replacement spot.	The Hamburg Basketball Consortium has rejected an application for a possible second placement.	Das Basketball-Projekt Hamburg Towers verzichtet auf eine Bewerbung für einen möglichen Nachrückerplatz.
2997	We won't be participating in the Wildcard race, said Ex-National player Pascal Roller who has been working on the concept for a professional club in the Hansestadt since 2012.	"We will not be participating in the Wildcard race,"" said former National Team player Pascal Roller, who has been working on a club concept in Hansestädt since 2012."	We will not be participating in the Wildcard race, said former National Team player Pascal Roll who has been working on a club concept since 2012 in the Hansestadt.	"""Wir werden nicht am Wildcard-Verfahren teilnehmen"", sagte Ex-Nationalspieler Pascal Roller, der seit 2012 das Konzept für einen Proficlub in der Hansestadt aufstellt."
2998	One of the first paintings on view was a masterpiece from Ludwigsburg.	The first paintings on canvas didn't seem to come from Ludwigsburg.	A first surname was not to be taken from the city of Ludwigsburg.	Ein erstes Aufatmen war aus Ludwigsburg dennoch nicht zu vernehmen.
2999	"""We're not involved with the Wildcard race so long as it's not decided that Düsseldorf has no license"", said Alexander Riesen of the N.C.R."	"""We're not working on the Wild Card game, as that isn't firmly established that Düsseldorf doesn't get a licence,"" says Alexander Reils of the Northern Neck Herald-Mail."	"""We aren't concerned with the Wildcard race; so much is not confirmed that Düsseldorf is not able to win this year"", wrote Alexander Roel in our press."	"""Wir beschäftigten uns nicht mit dem Wildcard-Verfahren, so lange nicht feststeht, dass Düsseldorf keine Lizenz erhält"", sagte Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil unserer Zeitung."
3000	The Dutch side can still claim further trophies at the European Cup until the 23. Mai and prove their economics as well.	The odds of Düsseldorf winning the European Cup for another round is still in the hands of the competition's chief judges, and his economic character can again be questioned.	The league's biggest players can still claim their place in the club's judging panel, and his economic character can also prove its credibility.	Bis zum 23. Mai kann Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets noch Unterlagen beim Schiedsgericht einreichen und seine wirtschaftliche Bundesliga-Tauglichkeit nachweisen.
3001	The license was only revoked once, but it was twice for the rest of the country.	The Ruhr region had twice received the licence before.	The Germans won the licence but twice, as well.	Bisher wurde den Rheinländern die Lizenz aber zweimal verweigert.
3002	The Court of Appeals is the final decision.	The tribunal is the last instance.	The Supreme Court of the United States is the final instance.	Das Schiedsgericht ist die letzte Instanz.
