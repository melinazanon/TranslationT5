982	He noticed that dogs just like humans do have the right brain hemisphere for movement of the left side, which is part of their function, and that both mammals play different roles in emotions.	He likewise noted that dogs, exactly like humans, are responsible for the right side of their brains which is engaged in the movement of the left side; and that the two emispherics play different roles in the feelings.	He realized that dogs like humans have a right brain half of what they do for movement of the left side, and that the two horses differ in their roles in feelings.

986	"Professor Vallortigara said that we have shown the dogs' films with dogs either in a natural-style version or a silhouette to change the way the lights are moving, and thus making the movements of the wings more linear than one direction."""	"Professor Valeriano said: ""We have shown the dogs' movies with dogs either a realistic version or a silent film to remove distracting aspects and, as a result, we were able to control the movements of the animals either in left or right."""	"Professor Vallortigara said that we saw the dogs' films with dogs – either a natural-looking version or a silent silhouette to cut out unwanted aspects, and thus the movement of the wings could be driven further towards left or right."""	"Professor Vallortigara sagte: „Wir haben den Hunden Filme mit Hunden gezeigt – entweder eine naturgetreue Version oder eine Silhouette, um ablenkende andere Aspekte zu eliminieren, und wir konnten damit die Bewegung des Schwanzes mehr nach links oder rechts steuern."""
987	When the animals looked as though a purely tomcat had moved towards the right (from the perspective of the wedeln dog) they remained totally relaxed.	When the animals looked as if they were totally inseparable, as a normal hard-working dog they probably saw the swift move towards right (from the angle of the wedeln dog), they remained completely relaxed.	When the animals looked like an ordinary dog who had moved a leap to the right (from the angle of the wedder dogs) they remained totally relaxed.	Wenn die Tiere sahen, wie ein ansonsten ausdrucksloser Hund den Schwanz nach rechts bewegt hat (von der Perspektive des wedelnden Hundes aus gesehen), blieben sie völlig entspannt.
988	As soon as the tension increased to links (even from the perspective of the dog that walked), their heart rate rose and, looking nervous, they could feel its rhythm.	They grew discontented by the sudden rise of the trend (moreover the perspective of the dog that weaped), so their heart rate rose and they resisted.	But the incline, rather than turning towards links (as in the case of the dog wet) rose so hard their heartbeat that they sewed unrelentingly.	War aber die Schwanzneigung vornehmlich nach links (wieder aus Perspektive des Hundes, der wedelt), so stieg ihre Herzfrequenz und sie sahen unruhig aus.
989	Despite the professor’s suggestion, the dogs do not communicate naturally through this movement.	According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs don't interact informally through these movements.	In Professor Vallortigara's opinion, the dogs don't make sense to each other through their movements.	Nach Ansicht von Professor Vallortigara kommunizieren die Hunde nicht absichtlich miteinander durch diese Bewegungen.
990	He's much more convinced that the dogs learned from experience which they should do when and where they should be concerned.	He's much more convinced that the dogs learned from experience which they should and shouldn't do.

991	"When different tendencies can be formed to different dogs, and the behavior of each breed with a tendency to towards courteous behaviour, and in the right side, a less friendly behavior, responses are based on that experience."""	"He said that, in the case of a variety of dog behaviours and the behavior of the wedgie with the tendency towards respectful behavior tending toward one not to be as welcoming as that initially thought it might be, and on the other side, he must respond to this experience on the basis of the experiences then."""	"He said that whenever there are numerous interactions with other dogs and the behavior of the weavers is likely to improve greatly when they snag in towards a kind behaviour, and the right side often produces less friendly behavior, so respond on base of those experiences."""	"Er sagte: „Wenn man verschiedene Begegnungen mit anderen Hunden hat und das Wedeln mit dem Schwanz in eine Richtung eher mit freundlichem Verhalten verknüpft ist und die rechte Seite eher ein weniger freundliches Verhalten produziert, dann reagiert man auf Basis dieser Erfahrungen."""
992	The fores say that the findings of trained and trained dogs could help give a better understanding of their animals' emotions.	The forekeepers say that the insights gained by trained hunters, zoologists and trainers could help build a better understanding of their animals' emotions.	The foresight suggests that the knowledge gained by breeders, veterinarians and trainers could contribute to a better understanding of their animals' emotional responses.	Die Forscher sagen, dass die Erkenntnisse Hundebesitzern, Tierärzten und Trainern zu einem besseren Verständnis der Emotionen ihres Tieres verhelfen könnten.
993	John Bradshaw, expert on dog behaviour and hospitality at the Faculty of Animal Science at University College Bristol explained that this wasn't the first study to be carried out when it was considered link and right for dogs.	John Bradshaw, the associate professor for animal behaviour and veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol explained that this was not the first study to be undertaken in the scientific inquiry into whether links and right were important for dogs.	John Bradshaw, professor of animal behaviour and parasitic ecology at the University of Bristol's Centre for Animal Ecology explained that this wasn't the first study which had been carried out in the faculties of veterinary science to investigate links and right for dogs.

995	"In a recent study at the University of Victoria in Canada there are following: ""Thousands go on a robot when its links suddenly widened and then turned unnatural – even though it's the same in Italian as foreground research."""	"In a second research project at the University of Victoria in Canada, said that ""Hundres of men are going on a robot when their weak links have become weak and non-directional – more specifically, when they're being studied in Italy."""	A further study at the University of Victoria in Canada revealed that long swans should walk on an unmarried foot when their ‘Baby’ links would become sharp and then become bendy instead. This is as critical as the Italian thesis on robotics in its history.	"In einer anderen Forschungsarbeit an der Universität von Victoria in Kanada stand Folgendes: „Hunde gehen eher auf einen Roboterhund zu, wenn sein ,Schwanz‘ links wedelt und nicht rechts, statt unruhig zu werden – genau andersherum als in der italienischen Studie."""
996	According to his statement the difference could therefore be significant that in the various studies the animals seen in the movies or robots were not interpretated as dogs.	According to his assertion, the difference could possibly arise because the dogs in the different studies were not interpretable as animals in the movies or robots.	According to his statement, the difference in whether the dogs used in the different studies are not necessarily dog models.	Laut seiner Aussage könnten die Unterschiede daher rühren, dass die Hunde in den verschiedenen Studien die Tiere in den Filmen bzw. die Roboterhunde nicht als Hunde interpretierten.

998	While there are many types of plants and flowers which can be used for different purposes, they still have to be studied in detail – dogs are not an exception, so Bradshaw says.	Although there are binding laws for many different mammals that both the brain and the physical body parts may be used for various purposes, many of the details still have to be carefully studied – dogs are not an exception,' says Bradshaw.	"The usefulness of many different plant species is the use of both brain and neural components for various purposes, but many details have to be added – and dogs are not the exception"", says Bradshaw."	"„Zwar gibt es beträchtliche Belege für viele verschiedene Säugetiere, dass die beiden Gehirnhälften für verschiedene Zwecke verwendet werden, doch müssen viele der Details noch bestimmt werden – und Hunde bilden da keine Ausnahme"", so Bradshaw."
999	Since their behaviour usually does not stick, it is unlikely to take long before we realize the temptation to move in one direction or another.	While their behaviour is largely obvious, it won't take long for us to see why the tension often swings in one direction and sometimes in another.	In those days their behaviour is very simple, it won't take long to understand why the tension sometimes turns in one direction or another.	Da sich ihr Verhalten aber einfach aufzeichnen lasse, werde es vermutlich nicht lange dauern, bis wir verstehen, weshalb sich der Schwanz manchmal in die eine, manchmal in die andere Richtung bewegt.

"In typical syphilis, Ditta claimed she was wrong. ""Were I a corrupt attorney, what I wasn't, and information on Scarborough refused to go on for 15 hours, then that would be just the thing."""

1218	His corruption led to a hoffnungslose compromise and at the beginning, for the reasons which led to his convictions, served as the basis for the committee on organized crime who appointed him to obtain valuable information on polizeirial issues.	His association with his fellow criminals led to a hoffnungsless compromise and in doing so he was likely to be among the leading members of the organized criminal network who advised him to collect valuable information on police investigation.	His codependence led to a hoffnungsless compromise, and ultimately for the motives leading members of the organised crime group who requested him to obtain valuable information on policing issues.	Seine Kokainabhängigkeit führte zu einer hoffnungslosen Kompromittierung und machte ihn empfänglich für die Motive führender Mitglieder der organisierten Kriminalität, die ihn beauftragten, wertvolle Informationen über polizeiliche Ermittlungen einzuholen.

1221	The specialised crime unit of Lancashire directed the proceedings against Ditta, but also to a conviction for coercion in three cases for coercion and justizbehaviour, a measure which our decision to bring into court led us to prosecute criminals.	The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the prosecution against Ditta, resulting in a murder conviction for corruption and justification, which our refusal to bring criminals before the Court was condemned.	The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire conducted the trials against Ditta, led also to a conviction for corruption and terrorism in three cases, which our unanimous decision meant to bring criminals before the court.	Die Serious and Organised Crime Unit von Lancashire leitete die Ermittlungen gegen Ditta, die auch zu einer Verurteilung in drei Fällen wegen des Besitzes von Kokain und Justizbehinderung führten, was unsere Entschlossenheit unterstreicht, Kriminelle vor Gericht zu bringen.

1228	Only twice were the policemen called to arrest young children who were being served by domestic servants.	The staff were only called twice to bulldoze children who were bathed in the common areas.	The government were only three times to eiring children, which were used against the police.	Die Beamten wurden lediglich zweimal zu eierwerfenden Kindern gerufen, welche diese gegen Hausfassaden warfen.
1229	There wasn't much damage done to the home, as the repairmen and restorers didn't know it at all.	Because the homeowners realised quickly and the pests disappeared as well, it should not cause any damage.	Due to the precautions afforded to the homeowners and the earthquakes falling locally, there should not be any damage to property.	Da die Hauseigentümer dies rechtzeitig erkannten und die Eierreste gleich entfernten, dürfte auch kein Sachschaden entstanden sein.
1230	Several snails were spotted in the area, but also there was no damage to the city's infrastructure.	Many pedestrians were killed in the area of the town, and perhaps some sylvester drivers were killed, but also no accident occurred here.

1232	Having failed to find his bicycle helmets in the police's vicinity before the incident, the police had to be involved instead.	Except for the police meeting in which the man he was carrying out his bicycle searchers in close proximity, the police had not been able to intervene further because of the incident.	The fact that the police found all his bicycles within easy reach did not make it necessary for the police to continue.

The particularly needed is to increase the safety on railway tracks - accidents occuring across the country often caused by trains crashing into other vehicles.	The particular safety measures at railway crossings should be increased - it happens to collisions between trains and other vehicles all over the country.	Besonders soll dabei die Sicherheit an Bahnübergängen erhöht werden - regelmäßig kommt es bundesweit zu Kollisionen von Zügen mit anderen Fahrzeuge.
1250	Assuming the town councils wish to carry out the renovation measures, they must share one third of the cost with the rest of them using rail and bus.	Rather than betray the town's regeneration plans, they have to share three/3rds of the cost; while others divide over rail and bridge.	If the local council are planning to undertake the works, they have to agree on a third of the cost, and for the rest, divide the line and foot.	Stimmen die Gemeinden den Umbaumaßnahmen zu, müssen sie sich mit einem Drittel an den Kosten beteiligen, den Rest teilen sich Bahn und Bund.

1252	There are the city, building an extension to the nearby tunnel network in the way the underground tunnels winding westwards.	There are the city plans to build a drainage project on the site of the underground tunnel wall which flows westwards the railway bridge.	There is the town to build an extension of the length of the tunnel mungare westwards through the railway tunnel.	Dort plant die Stadt, in Höhe des dortigen Tunnelmundes westlich der Bahngleise eine Ausbuchtung zu bauen.
1253	There could be bigger vehicles, such as those that carry the long tail in transit, but not needing to block the lights.	Larger vehicles like those that carry the long trunk in transit, without having to block the road.	There could be even larger vehicles, such as those that are to be transported by lane without having to block the streetcar.	Dort könnten auch größere Fahrzeuge, zum Beispiel solche, die Langholz transportieren, bei Gegenverkehr stehen, ohne die Gleise blockieren zu müssen.
1254	Therefore, construction workers urge using a necessary scaffold so as to prevent damage to the town's subsequent street network to spread over a crowded traffic jam.	Grießhabers are now considering ordering a necessary scaffold so as to allow the city to widen the adjacent street in order to ensure a reliable traffic flow.	It is advisable for builders to design a necessary sign so as to make the road connecting the town to the next one is wide enough to allow a symmetrical flow of traffic.	Grießhaber schlug daher vor, eine erforderliche Stützmauer so zu konstruieren, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße zu gegebener Zeit verbreitern könne, um einen reibungslosen Verkehrsfluss zu gewährleisten.
1255	"Several community debated the issue of whether there was any road traffic jam due to the size of the vehicle. Thomas Kipp raised the point with his recent inclination of the critic: ""Do we have so little money in our hand because we've got so few cars?"""	"The matter was discussed in the council, where some protests raised questions about the sustainability of a road bridge: ""Do we have to take so little money because of such small vehicles?"""	When discussing this on the council, some residents took the idea of a traffic jam as a consideration: Thomas Kipp brought his stance on the criticism's end: Should we be carrying so few vehicles in hand?	"Dies wurde im Gemeinderat kontrovers diskutiert, da einige Räte die Notwendigkeit einer Straßenverbreitung in Zweifel zogen: Thomas Kipp brachte mit seiner Äußerung die Stimmung der Kritiker auf den Punkt: ""Müssen wir wegen so wenigen Fahrzeugen so viel Geld in die Hand nehmen?"""
1256	"Tom Haas said the railway station's ""intersection"" is used for transporting gas."	"Mayor Tom Haas said he often used to go on trains that run over the ""emergency road"" () and use the canal bridge for logging of timbers."	Mayor Tom Haas said that the railway station is often used to transport old cars.	"Bürgermeister Thomas Haas widersprach: Der Bahnübergang ""Hirschen"" werde regelmäßig für Langholztransporte genutzt."
1257	"Even wood from the area ""Kuhbach"" will be carried along this route partly because the up to 20 meter long vehicles could not use the traffic signal on the Häberles bridge, because they couldn't cross there into the Main Street."	"Even wood from the section ""Kuhbach"" is being transported along this route, because the narrow vehicles with up to 20 m length could not use the road at Harrowles bridge because they couldn't get into the main street there."	"Even timber from the section ""Kuhbach"" will be carried over this route, because the ten meter long vehicles could not use the bypass on the mainline because they could've been blocked off at the junction."	"Selbst Holz aus dem Bereich ""Kuhbach"" werde teilweise über diese Strecke transportiert, weil die bis zu 20 Meter langen Fahrzeuge die Strecke an der Häberlesbrücke nicht nutzen könnten, weil sie dort nicht in die Hauptstraße abbiegen könnten."
1258	A further layer of the network is the line as a public transport route for those vehicles which should not use this tunnel when it's blocked off the main street, agreed Haas.	Beyond these, the network can be used as a means of transport for those vehicles that cannot use this tunnel if it's closed down Main Street, said chief argument.	Further to the lines extended as umbilicals for the vehicles not allowed to use the tunnel when it is at the main street, argumentated Haas.	Darüber hinaus diene die Strecke als Umleitungfür diejenigen Fahrzeuge, die den Tunnel nicht benutzen dürfen, wenn die Hauptstraße gesperrt ist, argumentierte Haas.
1259	"In the event that Kirchberg and Castle Mountain tunnels need to be built and maintained, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the ""railway crossroad"" can also become a significant traffic interconnection for an extended period."	"In light of the fact that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be built and erected, as is the case in Wolfach today, even a major bridge crossing may still remain open for an extended period at the ""Impact Bridge"", however."	"Since it should not be obvious that culverts and tunnels are needed to be built and widened, as has been the case in Wolfach right now, the ""gateway"" may be used for an important traffic corridor for a long time."	"Da abzusehen sei, dass Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnel umgebaut und saniert werden müssten, wie dies derzeit in Wolfach der Fall ist, könne dem Bahnübergang ""Am ""Hirschen"" auch für einen längeren Zeitraum eine wichtige Verkehrsbedeutung zukommen."
1260	The plot came to an agreement to allow the measure of the road's width to be extended.	The investigations began to be carried out to determine what the proposed widening of the road would cost.	The plot came up with the intention of having the street widen.	Die Räte kamen überein, untersuchen zu lassen, welche Kosten die angedachte Verbreiterung der Straße verursachen würde.
1261	"The construction of the railway crossing more seriously assumed the necessary walls and fittings were sufficiently thick to accommodate the city's broader traffic system; in consequence, the extension of the rail bridge eventually reaching the ""stationary line"" section of the tram line being extended to about 5,5 meters for the purpose of opening."	For the purpose of extending the crossing lengthening the specified period for construction of the necessary bridges so as to accommodate the city's local rail network, this was subjected to the cap on the measure of upkeep of the bridge over the crossing not to exceed 5 meters, the width of the bridge in the following section being extended to around the junction wall.	The costs of building the bridge over the bridge were ultimately borne in proportion to the number of meters required to build the bridge over the crossing street, which was later shortened to around 5,5 metres in order to accommodate the rail link between the station and the railway crossing.	"Ungeachtet dessen wurde dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs mehrheitlich zugestimmt mit der Maßgabe, dass die erforderliche Stützmauer so gebaut wird, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße Richtung ""Bahnhofstraße"" gegebenenfalls für Begegnungsverkehr auf rund 5,5 Meter ausbauen könne."
1262	"Construction of the rail crossing at the Mobley could however a whole different problem arisen, as the crossing through the heavily crowded ""gallery"" to the region."	The extension of the line crossing to the railway station in the light rail might therefore pose a whole other problem than the construction of the railway crossing on the steep hilltop road.	"The extension of the tram bridge at the railway station in the town of Trautwein could pose quite another problem when travelling the ""greek pedestrian way"" up to the station."	"Der Umbau des Bahnübergangs bei der Gerberei Trautwein könnte dagegen ein ganz anderes Problem nach sich ziehen, das die Zufahrt in den stark ansteigenden ""Geroltzhäuser Weg"" betrifft."
1263	The administration had examined the plans for the line from the engineering consultancy B.B. Brown, having doubted whether the planned connection between the railway station and then without any further connections would be possible.	The administration had the plans for the track, commissioned by the Engineer's Office of Railways, because they doubted whether the planned extension of the line at the junction between the former railroad station and the station would be successful elsewhere.	The administration had the plans for the line's construction from the engineering firm Browning, having doubted whether the planned extension of the railway station would succeed without further action.	Die Verwaltung hatte die Umbaupläne der Bahn vom Ingenieurbüro Breinlinger untersuchen lassen, da sie Zweifel daran hatte, ob der geplante Anschluss des Geroltzhäuser Wegs dann noch ohne weiteres möglich sei.
1264	The study came to the conclusion that it wasn't possible for the traffic jam to cause longer cars to sit on the road.	The research came to the conclusion that it wasn't possible to conclude that the road conditions could lead to longer driving.	The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not possible to conclude that the traffic conditions on the road might cause longer vehicles to be in.	Die Untersuchung kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass nicht auszuschließen sei, dass die Neigungsverhältnisse der Straße dazu führen könnten, dass längere Fahrzeuge aufsitzen.
1265	The responsibility to do that here comes from the city as a traffic jam.	The responsibility for that's the fault of the town, and yet again, is put up by the city as a bridge collapsed.	The responsibility here comes to the city, who are again the bridgeslayers of roads.	Die Verantwortung hierfür trage wiederum die Stadt als Straßenbaulastträgerin.
1266	The build may soon settle liability disputes.	The build could settle later liability disputes.	The building may soon become liable.	Der Umbau könne demnach Haftungsstreitigkeiten nach sich ziehen.
1267	Since both the timber abutments and the timber used in the current state of repair aren't good, suggested Haas.	Neither the sack of wood nor the banquettes working in the present state of construction ought to be accepted, argued Haas.	Because both the fuel and the bolts in the current state of repair can't be supported, suggested Haas.	Da sowohl die Holzabfuhr als auch das Abbiegen im aktuellen Ausbauzustand funktionierten, solle man dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs nicht zustimmen, argumentierte Haas.
1268	The risk of hitting the crossroads at this place is significantly lower than in other train tracks, being just opposite the center of the station. This is where a good view from the station is best.	The risk of a collision on the crossing site however is significantly lower than those in other railway station crossings because the line just above the junction has good views.	At this location, the risk of a collision between a vehicle standing in the cross section and another on the platform is much lower than that for other trains crossings, because it's just past the stoplight centre, which provides good view.	Auch sei an dieser Stelle das Risiko einer Kollision des Zuges mit einem auf dem Übergang stehenden Fahrzeug deutlich geringer als an den anderen Bahnübergängen, weil sich direkt daneben der Haltepunkt Mitte befinde, zu dem eine gute Sichtverbindung bestehe.
1269	Even a narrow section of the main street should have been cut to this point.	Even a tiniest of the main station has already been cut down to this place, at least until it's sufficiently dismantled so as not to cause a collision.	Even a small number of pods from the main station must already be arranged in such a way that they cannot damage any broken glass.	Selbst Züge vom Hauptbahnhof her müssten an dieser Stelle schon soweit abgebremst sein, dass keine Kollision drohe.
1270	Construction of this tunnelway got the approval of the town to prolong it, so that the city council needed to work out the problem with the sitting vehicles, so the rail line could instead be put up after the construction works finished.	"Majoritatea was to have the opposite effect on the extension of this tram line, as the town council ""had to deal with the problem with parking attendants"" so that the railway network could accept the rest of the work after it finished."	"Construction of this bridge fell short of approval, so that the city council had to deal with the problem with sitting vehicles ""fortified"", so the railway station could then focus on the rail line after completing the building works."	"Mehrheitlich wurde dem Umbau dieses Bahnübergangs die Zustimmung verweigert, da die Stadt Schiltach das Problem mit aufsitzenden Fahrzeugen ""ausbaden müsste"", so die Räte, da sich die Bahn nach Abschluss der Bauarbeiten aus der Verantwortung zurückziehen könne."
1271	"When the view isn't problematic, the grotons built along the rail platforms ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Voor Kuhbach"", already junctions with the rail system since they were built at the time of the construction works."	"The construction work on the rail crossings ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Coreia"", formed for the interchange of carriageways with the rail network already."	"When considering the problems of construction on the platform overhangs ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Kuhbach"", the junctions already broken into inter-rails traffic jams."	"Als unproblematisch betrachtet das Gremium die Umbauten an den Bahnübergängen ""Vor Heubach"" und ""Vor Kuhbach"", für die bereits Kreuzungsvereinbarungen mit der Bahn getroffen wurden."

Der Geschäftsführer erklärte, er würde Aussagen von Mitarbeitern nicht akzeptieren, wonach diese sich nicht getraut hätten, ihren Vorgesetzten Meldung zu erstatten.
1614	That's the reason why he said his relationship with Lord became so extensive that she had not reported it.	Statually, he said that her friendship with Lord was greatly affected, which is why she had not reported him.	What he said was the fact that her friendship with Lord proved to be her judgment, which has not helped her to report.	Stattdessen, so sagte er, habe vielmehr ihre Freundschaft mit Lord ihr Urteilsvermögen beeinträchtigt, weshalb sie ihn nicht gemeldet hätten.

1624	The two towers are rising to the top of Europe at a height of 157 metres.	Two hundred metre wide, the two towers towering in the sky and transform into Europe's second highest cathedral.	Across the sky, the two towers rage in the direction of the city, arcing over 157 meters to the top of the church tower.	Rund 157 Meter ragen die beiden Türme in den Himmel und machen ihn zum zweithöchsten Kirchengebäude Europas.
1625	The few visitors who are admiring the two stained glass windows suspect a large number of tourists could also discover it beneath the Dome.	Only a few visitors who can see the two stained glass windows suggest that there is a lot of material to be found under the dome, as well.	But only few visitors, which are admiring the two spires of holy churches, say that there's a great deal to see and visit beneath the Dome.	Doch nur wenige Besucher, die die beiden filigranen Kirchtürme bestaunen, ahnen, dass es auch unter dem Dom eine Menge zu entdecken gibt.

1628	"The roundabout is quite nonsensical: ""We're starting at the deep end"", says Schulze."	"The path starts quite unexpected: ""We're starting in the low section,"" says Schulze."	"The round's really strange: ""We'll start in the garage"", says Schulze."	"Der Rundgang beginnt ganz unspektakulär: ""Wir fangen in der Tiefgarage an"", sagt Schulze."
1629	The town council wanted to create an autonomous city, and therefore remained limited to what the old townpeople used to do.	In the seventy years, the city council wanted to form an auto-justified town, and so remained a mere standing it was once again.	The town council wished to create an auto-just city, and therefore deceived the old townpeople who had left it just as they did what they knew was not too big.	In den siebziger Jahren wollten die Stadtväter eine autogerechte Stadt, und deshalb blieb von den Resten der alten Stadtmauer nur das stehen, was nicht zu groß war.
1630	Almost all of the park benches are now empty, so even though they are empty, they still tip their car.	The majority of the car-pool users hurried over to the busy roads today, leaving only their cars.	Most people who use the park house today rushes past the small green area and pick up only their car.	Die meisten Benutzer des Parkhauses eilen deshalb heute auch an den römischen Überresten vorbei und stellen nur ihr Auto ab.
1631	But looking closer, for example, people who were not really interested in archeology discovered a medieval fort at the park deck D2, which was surrounded by a roof made from a metal mesh.	But looking closer, a detailed search for archaeological remains found in the Parkdeck D2 revealed a partly constructed archeological excavation.	But genauer looked, by out in Park Deck D2, an antiquities museum had been discovered.

"""Es sind Reste der römischen Stadtmauer, die in der zweiten Hälfte des ersten Jahrhunderts nach Christus erbaut wurde"", erzählt Schulze."
1634	Before it goes back to the usual time of day, the instructors can just grab a glance at the high level park bench, in a wide angle of more than fifteen meters.	Before it back to daylight, participants who attend the playground on the top level can still catch a good view of the shallow pool of pupils with shorter than 15 mt depth.	Before it turns back again to daylight, teachers may take a look at the underlying floor surface before throwing the 15 meters deep pupils into a finster.	Bevor es wieder zurück ans Tageslicht geht, lässt Schulze die Teilnehmer auf der oberen Parkebene noch einen Blick in einen finsteren, 15 Meter tiefen Schacht werfen.
1635	That's one of the old ideas, which unfortunately will not be realized.	This is the grave of old lores that, unfortunately, are seldom ever truly rescued.	This is the money of old times, which is probably rarely real.	Das ist der Brunnen des alten Domes, der leider auch kaum wahrgenommen wird.
1636	Next to the roundabout is the pretorium, which hosts the participants down into the dark again.	The next station on the roundtable is the meeting hall, and participants there descend into the inferno again.	The next station in the round is the exposition; these attendees go down again into the underground.	Nächste Station des Rundgangs ist das Prätorium, und hier steigen die Teilnehmer wieder hinunter in die Tiefe.
1637	We visit the summit of the Alps, the base of the CCAA.	Here we see the flank of the most powerful mountain – the North American region, the East European continent.	We experience the highest point of a mountain, the Great Alpine, the setting of the famous Paris Olympic Games.	Wir erleben hier den Amtssitz des einst mächtigsten Mannes nördlich der Alpen, des Prätors der CCAA.
1638	What CCAA means, visitors want to know.	What CCAA means, would you like to know?	What CCAA means is something that one wants to know.	Was CCAA bedeutet, möchte eine Besucherin wissen.
1639	"The abkürung in German means ""Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinenean"", which in good German means ""Stats of ancient law and Agrepnean Emperors founded under the reign of Kaiser Claudius as the Ordo de Papes for the first Time"""	"The Abkürung (so-called Colonia Claudia A.A.C.R. ), is written in good German as ""Stadt relics of the Roman Empire and the town of Agrippinen, founded under King Claudius at the ADULIUM for the Kaiser's Oratory"""	"The abkürung stands for ""Colonia Claudia A.R.A.A.C.C.A.E.A.C.I.A.C.P.S. a.

1640	And when it comes to pretoria, it is the former seat of the Roman Empire, the centre of Rome's medieval empire.	The prefecture is all round the old Statuary Palace, the ruins of the Roman Imperium in the Rhine.	During the Pretorian period, it's around the former statuette palace, the ancient capital of Roman Empire on the Rhine.	Und beim Prätorium handelt es sich um den ehemaligen Statthalterpalast, das Machtzentrum des römischen Imperiums am Rhein.

Vom Vorraum der Ausstellung führt ein Tunnelzugang zum römischen Abwasserkanal, der hier auf rund 120 Metern Länge erhalten ist.
1642	"You can walk along the so-called ""Claca Maxima"" for a bit while you wish to, ribbons swinging up the guests."	You can walk a portion of the so-called Cloaves with ease, and where you want to, turn out the guests' placards.	"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima in quiet, if you want to. ""If you want to go there, you can just walk along the road diagonally"" is high-pitched guest scorching."	"""Sie können ruhig ein Stück entlang der sogenannten Cloaca Maxima entlanggehen, wenn Sie wollen"", muntert Schulze die Gäste auf."
1643	A surprise has still got its toll.	A surprise has still got a coat in the mail.	There's a surprise: Schulze has still got to be created.	Eine Überraschung hat Schulze noch.

1646	The Jewish community built their bath deep in the ground so as to grow up roots. These were able to tap into the soil at the source of the water that was impermeabil for the local dyes.	The Jewish community built their bath deep in the soil to give a soak to the groundwater necessary for the daily washing-up.	The Jewish community built their bath deep in the ground to reach the groundwater which would be drained for the ritual washing.	Die jüdische Gemeinde baute ihr Bad tief in den Boden, um an das Grundwasser zu kommen, das für die rituellen Waschungen unabdingbar war.
1647	By today, at the end of the Mikwe, stretching back from the ancient Roman Empire to the eighteen century, different rivers could be accessed through an alteration of the Rhein.	Up to the end of the tributary, where the river waters from the Middle Ages cross over to the eighth century, varying water levels were possible through changing pebbles in the Rhein.	Currently, at the end of the Mikwe, which go back nearly an century after the Great Flood, diverse flows through the Rhine can be used by different peas.	Bis heute sind im unteren Ende der Mikwe, deren Ursprünge bis ins achte Jahrhundert zurückgehen, unterschiedliche Wasserstände durch wechselnde Pegel des Rheins ablesbar.
1648	The museum will be part of an archaeological area on the ground floor where the building work will begin in Kukurze.

1654	They're not all experienced racers, but people looking for energy and expense, while seeking an accessible way to world class competitions.	They aren't all experienced race drivers. They are people who are on their way to a competitive edge in sports.	You aren't all experienced racers; they're people who are looking for excitement and cost, or a way to World Cup racing.	Sie sind nicht alle erfahrene Rennfahrer, sondern Leute, die auf der Suche nach Spannung und Abenteuer sind sowie nach einem erreichbaren Weg zu Weltklasse-Veranstaltungen.
1655	We are happy to partner with Land Rover and the MSA to increase our ability to experience new road events in the US and abroad, and believe that the format of touring different regions of the world is changing dramatically as we discover the potential of rally races both locally and internationally.	We are glad to be able to partner with Land Rover and the MSA in this way, and believe that new possibilities have become available to test the various rally events held in Britain and abroad, including the ability to learn about the different sections of the road and how to make sense of it.	We're excited to know this partnership with Land Rover and the MSA could open in future and believe that the format of the various Rally-Diszipline races in Britain and Europe will allow the preparation of the ground conditions for its production and use in the environment.	Wir freuen uns, diesen Weg in Partnerschaft mit Land Rover und der MSA eröffnen zu können und glauben, dass das Format neue Möglichkeiten erschließt, die verschiedenen Rally-Disziplinen in Großbritannien und dem Ausland zu erleben und Neulinge auf die Strapazen und die Wirklichkeit von Rally Raid vorzubereiten.
1656	We really enjoyed putting in practice the Defender Challenge weapon, which will become an independent mastermind.	We had a really good time developing the Defender Challenge novel – it will become an unprecedented masterpiece.	We were really enjoying developing the Defender Challenge – it will become an undertook mastermind.	Wir hatten wirklich Spaß daran, den Defender Challenge-Wagen zu entwickeln – das wird eine unterhaltsame Meisterschaft.
1657	Further to that, there are training and test days during the Defender Challenge in February and also the option of taking part in the World Cup in North Africa and the Nahen Osten.	In the same vein, there are two training and testing days in the Defender Challenge in February, as well as the possibility of taking part in the Wight Races in North Africa and the Nahen Osten.

1659	A new day, a new history of independence.	A new day, a new era of independence.	A new day, a new story of independence.	Ein neuer Tag, eine neue Schreckensgeschichte zur Unabhängigkeit.
1660	We will now be warning that a separate Scotland is needed to take the Schengen Declaration into consideration as an EU member state.	This time, we are advised that an independent Scotland will have to join the Schengen Treaty as a condition for the EU membership.	We are predicting an independent Scotland to act as the Council of Europe Member State for the Schengen Republic.	Diesmal werden wir gewarnt, dass ein unabhängiges Schottland erforderlich sei, um dem Schengen-Raum als Bedingung für die EU-Mitgliedschaft beizutreten.
1661	It is the epistemology of British voyages along the Atlantic coast.	This is the last word for medieval times.	It's the crucial words for tale of travellers and at a reasonably high level between Berwick and Hadrian's Walls.	Das liefert das Stichwort für Geschichten über Passkontrollen in Berwick und eine mit Stacheldraht gesicherte Grenze entlang des Hadrianswalls.
1662	In the Strathclyde Vodley debate, the possible economic benefits of extending the European Union's travel freer would be underestimated, but in terms of practical considerations, it was assumed that they played no role in the recent outbreak of the Strathclyde Vodley debate.	Ultimately, in the Strathclyde antidote pollutioning of the economic benefits associated with greater freedom of travel to restful Europe did not play a part in the question of possible economic advantages, as it were, at least in the pitch black issue.	In fact, in the Strathclyde vote the possible economic benefits of being freer in resting Europe (an exception made to that) in the German Struggle.	In der Tat wurde in der Strathclyde-Vorlage auf die möglichen wirtschaftlichen Vorteile hingewiesen, die mehr Reisefreiheit im restlichen Europa mit sich bringen würde, doch spielte dies – erwartungsgemäß – in den Schlagzeilen keine Rolle.
1663	Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often abide by their strict rules, when it's cheaper for them.	No one mentioned that the EU-member states often adopt their strict rules when it's cheaper for them.	No one mentioned that the EU states often adopted their strict rules when they are cheaper.	Auch hat niemand erwähnt, dass sich die EU-Mitgliedsstaaten häufig ihre strikten Regeln zurechtbiegen, wenn es für sie günstiger ist.
1664	Because Scotland has not yet been included in the 1966 World Cup, the FTA would just like to abolish the planned no-no-negotiation of Brussels as a small inconvenience to the true expression of their will.	Being that Scotland hasn't a chance to be a national team member at the moment, the suspended ban on bridge construction would only be a small swig in the context of what truly is wanted from the Scottish border.	Since Scotland did not participate in the current UEFA Cup, the fortified notbeach would be just a small inconvenience to Brussels.	Da Schottland derzeit nicht zum Schengen-Raum gehört, wäre die fortgesetzte Nichtbeachtung für Brüssel nur ein kleines Zugeständnis im Gegenzug für das, was man wirklich von den Schotten will.
1665	Also, no story.	No story.	No story is really a story.	Also eigentlich keine Story.
1666	"And one, who has come up so late in life already — she can even have a fossil: It was the first time I heard the phrase ""Undependence means Passover"" before - least 40 years ago."	"And one who has gotten so many years in her career that she already knows how to make food. This is the first time I've heard the phrase ""Undependence means torture"" before a minimum of 40 years ago."	"And one who has come so far in years already the equivalent of a fossil: The first time I heard the phrase ""Undependence means paedophilia"" before at least 40 years ago."	"Und eine, die schon so in der Jahre gekommen ist, dass sie bereits einem Fossil gleicht: Das erste Mal habe ich die „Unabhängigkeit bedeutet Passkontrollen""-Ente vor mindestens 40 Jahren gehört."
1667	This is an interesting point when retelling this lost tale keeps getting interesting.	It's an interesting point to be repeated in the making of this long lost tale.	This makes an interesting point when replaying this lost tale – much like the time at which these stories are lost.	Dabei geht ein interessanter Punkt beim ständigen Wiederholen dieser uralten Geschichte verloren.
1668	Why should one expect an independent Scotland that dances the European Pfeife after another?	Why should we expect from an independent Scotland that the same dances like European peacocks?	Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance Pfeife like the European Union?	Weshalb sollte man von einem unabhängigen Schottland erwarten, dass es nach der europäischen Pfeife tanzt?
1669	Why does the Londoner Joch have to be replaced by the Brussels one?	Why does Londoner joeches against the Brussels bridge, especially now?	Why do the Londoners against the Brusselsians, particularly now?	Warum das Londoner Joch gegen das von Brüssel eintauschen, besonders jetzt?
1670	They're the real European news: after the war, the large, following the war infancy plan for the Union of Europe is in the stock.	They are the really European news: The large, post-war plan to union Europe is on the table.	They are truly European news: the large plan to unify Europe, which was carried out after the war, is in the stock.	Das sind die wirklichen europäischen Neuigkeiten: Der große, nach dem Krieg gefasste Plan zur Vereinigung Europas ist ins Stocken geraten.
1671	The project Europe was officially abandoned in the european Union.	The European Union officially sanctioned the project.	The European project was officially cancelled by the European Union.	Mit der Eurokrise ist das Projekt Europa offiziell gestorben.
1672	Almost all EU countries win parties on the ground that they consider to be EU or European Union citizens.	All EU countries win prizes on the basis of whether they wish to be EU citizens or to vote Euro as a currency.	Almost all in the EU have won party seats on ground that were economically feasible or wants to spend Euro as a community currency.	Überall in der EU gewinnen Parteien an Boden, die EU-feindlich sind oder den Euro als Gemeinschaftswährung über Bord werfen möchten.
1673	Even in Germany, the European Parliament's Alternative to Germany – not founded until this year – could stifle nearly five million votes cast in the elections for the General Election in September, effectively driving out the Free Democratic Republic (British Liberal Democrats) from the House of Commons.	Even in Germany, the Euro-Bulletin Party Alternative for Germany (founded only this year) managed to achieve about five million votes during the vote in the Federal elections in September, effectively excluding the Liberal Democrats (also known as the British Liberals).	"Even in Germany, the opposition a laurents could toger the election of the European Parliament in September – which allowed them to select almost five million votes (in the forthcoming general election) for themselves, effectively conceding the ""Federal Democratic Party"" (British Liberal Democrats) out of the party table."	Selbst in Deutschland konnte die euroskeptische Partei Alternative für Deutschland – erst dieses Jahr gegründet – knapp fünf Millionen Stimmen bei der Bundestagswahl im September für sich ergattern und damit effektiv die Freien Demokraten (das Äquivalent zu den britischen Liberal Democrats) aus dem Bundestag vertreiben.
1674	Even though it was a utopian dream to create a European Union, there was always a secret resistance to the plan to achieve this.	There was always a silent resistance against the plan to create a European Union.	There was still a low-key resistance to the plan for a free Europe.	Es gab schon immer heimischen Widerstand gegen den Plan, ein föderalistisches Europa zu schaffen.
1675	The current economic report certainly shows a turn for the worse.	The current economic climate is certainly a turning point.	The current economic survey does not reveal a major factor.	Die aktuelle Wirtschaftskrise stellt sich allerdings als Wendepunkt heraus.
1676	Because the relationship between Berlin and the European Central Bank is that of a strict Sparpolitik in liaison with the hanging Jack, in which the national economy through the Stability of the Common Wage is established, many people think the project Europe has gone too far.	In the context of the convergence of Berlin and the European Central Bank, which can engender an economic engagement with the national economy by the establishment of the common currency, many people believe that the project Europa has gone too far.	As the impact of Berlin and the European Central Bank on the global economy is bound to be tighter than that debate in favor of the aforementioned Währungsunion, many people believe that the project Europa has gone too far.	Wegen der von Berlin und der Europäischen Zentralbank verhängten strengen Sparpolitik in Verbindung mit der Zwangsjacke, in die die jeweilige nationale Wirtschaft durch das Festhalten an der gemeinsamen Währung genötigt wird, sind viele Menschen der Ansicht, das Projekt Europa sei zu weit gegangen.
1677	The Euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments have indulged in excessive deficits of budget — only Greece.	The crisis of the Euro has little to do with national governments incurring severe budget deficits – it was only Greece that fell under the weight of those which were already in place.	The crisis of the Euro has little to do with national governments incurring excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.	Die Krise des Euro hat wenig damit zu tun, dass nationale Regierungen exzessive Haushaltsdefizite verursachen – das war nur in Griechenland der Fall.
1678	Stattually the Eurosystem has divided its members on exchange rates, which are particularly important for German exporters – and many German politicians want to let this be so.	Statistically, the Eurosystem has tipped its members on currency fluctuations, which are very positive for German exporters – and that German politicians would like to see it.	Statistically, the Eurosystem has stuck to its members on exchange rates which are especially important for German exporters – and many German politicians want to have it left.	Stattdessen hat das Eurosystem seine Mitglieder auf Wechselkurse festgenagelt, die für deutsche Exporteure vorteilhaft sind – und das möchten deutsche Politiker gern so lassen.
1679	If there's not a suitable localization for an agricultural export, South Europe is again confronted with a mixed productivity gap in production against Germany.	Without the possibility of an improvement of local economics, South Europe with a high-productivity gap is again found in Germany.	Without the possibility of an uptake of the local currency, Europe with a productivity gap is facing backwards to Germany.	Ohne die Möglichkeit einer Abwertung der lokalen Währung findet sich Südeuropa mit einem eingebauten Produktivitätsnachteil gegenüber Deutschland wieder.
1680	The only possible solution is to reduce the number of strikes and public transport – the idea is being spread from Berlin.	The only way to reduce the number of ills and public expenditure is by going from Berlin to be reduced.	The only alternative is to cut taxes and public expenditure, which is often ruled out of Berlin.	Die einzige Möglichkeit besteht darin, Löhne und öffentliche Ausgaben zu kürzen – angespornt von Berlin.
1681	Behind the current state and wage problems is a deep, regional productivity problem.	The current state and gender problem is deepening the European productivity problem.	Behind the current crisis of state and gender is a deeper national product problem.	Hinter den aktuellen Etat- und Währungsproblemen liegt ein tiefer gehendes europäisches Produktivitätsproblem.
1682	"When due to the construction of the ""green"" energy plant in Brussels, which freed up French and German energy companies on account of the consumer, the European industry cost the double for electricity and gas compared with the United States."	As part of the widespread defeat of the Brussels directives which regulate the payment of taxes on French and German electricity companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry is paid to the United States by the double for electricity and gas when compared with the United States.	"During the austerity campaign against the government of Brussels, which involved the seven-nation ""green energy industry"" (green energy rules) demanding the collaboration of French and German energy companies on account of consumers, Europe costs the EU workforce the double for electricity and gas in comparison with the United States."

If the anti-EU coalition can flourish in these elections – and this is very likely – then it may well become a bloc of the European Parliament for instance.	Falls die Anti-EU-Parteien bei diesen Wahlen gut abschneiden – und das ist sehr gut möglich –, dann könnte erstmals ein solcher Block das Europäische Parlament dominieren.
1693	This is the point from which I want to look further: In not far future will the growing resentment against the EU and the common desire for the creation of the Euro converge.

Die SNP-Regierung in Schottland ist – bemerkenswerterweise – die erfolgreichste politische Bewegung gegen die Sparpolitik in Europa und hat 2011 eine spektakuläre Mehrheit aufgrund der Ablehnung der vorgeschlagenen (und vorgenommenen) Kürzungen gewonnen, die der Labour-Finanzminister Alistair Darling und die nachfolgende Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition zu verantworten hatten.
1705	Schottland would be proud to vote undependence now only to get a Sparpolitik then from Berlin and Brussels.

1792	Nerves on both sides led to errors and points being given as penalties; the invariability of the penalty during match play prevented contestants from catching passes, hindering their concentration on playing the game.	The nerves on both sides were notable particularly when it was blamed on the sacking of mistakes and points for a lacklustre display of ballons; equally in the case of the games was the pre-tournament playability of the scorecard, where the score was too high for the referee to win a penalty, while during some critical matchdays the goalie was seen to be missing the target net.	The nerves on both sides caused problems mainly when it came to the introduction of mistakes and points, but even when it was needed more frequently during game day, the playfulness of the ball as well as the presentation of the penalty prevented the goalkeeper from predicting the winner in the future.	Nervosität auf beiden Seiten verursachte vor allem bei der Ballannahme Fehler und Punktegeschenke; auch bei den Pässen war die Präzision zuweilen Mangelware und in einigen kritischen Spielszenen verhinderte der Übereifer den Blick für mögliche Punktgewinne.

1798	The spillage, the spill on May 15. 2009, as a precaution, was an event so serious as the protection of future, as a prosecutor claims.

The flood, which happened on May 15, 2009, was a tragic event, at the core of what is considered to be a future emergency, as its perpetrators say.	Das Hochwasser, das Gechingen am 15. Mai 2009, unvorbereitet traf, sei ein einschneidendes Ereignis gewesen, das die Frage nach Schutzmaßnahmen für die Zukunft aufwarf, so Häußler.
1799	A flood damage assessment was undertaken in the neighbourhood of Addington which is now the basis for the flood prevention scheme in East Anglia.

Eine Flussgebietsuntersuchung war mit der Nachbargemeinde Aidlingen in Auftrag gegeben worden, die nun Grundlage für das Hochwasserschutzkonzept in Gechingen ist.
1800	The goal is to protect as much of the land as possible, says said a local gardener.	The protection of as much as possible of a protected area, so said the writer.	The protection of as much as possible of the land it's intended to build is the goal, so says the farmer.	"""Der Schutz möglichst vieler bebauter Grundstücke ist das Ziel"", so Häußler."
1801	The plan to protect against a given German weather service over the next 100 years from rain expected to last forever was called for.	The recent lay-off of the Dutch flood protection plan for the 100 years to expect from a future German forecast has been steady.	A swift turn has set in motion plans to protect against a rising tide from a German weather service for all 100 years, according exclusively to the dates and times.	Zugrunde gelegt ist der Planung der Schutz vor einem laut Deutschen Wetterdienst statistisch alle 100 Jahre zu erwartenden Hochwasser.

1804	The flood waters caused serious damage to the lake's surface in 2009 predicted a 1000-year flood.	The waters caused by the flooding that caused terrible damage in 2009, declared a 1,000-year flood.	The waters that caused devastating damage in 2009 have spoken of a 1,000 year long flood.	Die Wassermassen, die 2009 in Gechingen zu beträchtlichen Schäden geführt hatten, entsprachen einem 1000-jährigen Hochwasser.
1805	"A total protection can't exist, but a relative improvement can be achieved"", says the waiter."	"""Of course there's no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement,"" said the crow."	"""A definite protection isn't the answer, but we can achieve an improvement relative to it,"" says the Häuteler."	"""Einen absoluten Schutz gibt es nicht, aber eine relative Verbesserung können wir erzielen"", so Häußler."
1806	To achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima needs around four million euros in chess to be invested, whilst the county unitary allocation can be reached by a region-wide count of about 70 percent.	To achieve the protection of HQ 100a-Klima, it is necessary to invest about four million euros in local authorities, while municipalities can estimate its population by roughly 70 percent.

Um den Schutz HQ 100aKlima zu erzielen, müssen in Gechingen rund vier Millionen Euro investiert werden, wobei die Gemeinde mit Landeszuschüssen in Höhe von rund 70 Prozent rechnen kann.
1807	Many people believe that it only happens when there is a comprehensive plan to be implemented.	Not all people like to think the idea of funding will only be in the form of a complete plan.	Many people are unsure that the idea of full-scale development is feasible.	Häußler wies aber darauf hin, dass es die Förderung nur gebe, wenn ein Gesamtkonzept umgesetzt werde.
1808	The town's influence was determined in this respect.	That's why the community was given the power to affect citizens.	A decision was made on the impact of citizens in that regard.	Dazu sei die Gemeinde auf die Mitwirkung der Bürger angewiesen.
1809	A complicated planning and approval process must be completed.	The preparation and approval process for planning and constructing projects must be conducted independently.	A complex process of planning and approval needs to be completed.	Ein aufwändiges Planungs- und Genehmigungsverfahren müsse absolviert werden.
1810	In the best case 2016, with the implementation set to begin.	In the best case 2016 could be begun with the implementation.	I think 2016 will best begin with the implementation.	Im besten Fall könne 2016 mit der Umsetzung begonnen werden.
1811	Among other things, there is the protection concept already introduced in the last week in the council report (we reported) local measures at the mouth of the river Valley from the Stammheim valley.	Under and above is the strategy for protecting the rivers which were presented locally last week in the local council, where we reported local measures affecting the flow of the river Irm from the Stammheimer valley.	In particular, there is the protection plan proposed in the last week at the council's meeting on local measures in the area of the river Irm (streamwater was reported) from the Stammheimer Tal.	Unter anderem sieht das Schutzkonzept, das bereits in der vergangenen Woche im Gemeinderat präsentiert wurde (wir berichteten) lokale Maßnahmen im Zufluss des Flüsschens Irm aus dem Stammheimer Tal vor.

Im Anschluss an die Präsentation des Hochwasserschutzkonzepts nutzten die Teilnehmer die Gelegenheit, ihre Anliegen einzubringen.
1813	Under anderem, the question was raised why no further dams or waterfalls were planned to protect the plants.	They asked why there was no further use of caves or backwashes to protect the ancient monuments.	Several people asked why there were no plans to plant more dams and floodwaters to protect the orchid.	Unter anderem wurde in Frage gestellt, warum nicht mehr Dämme und Rückhaltebecken zum Schutz des Ortes geplant seien.
1814	Gregor Kühn, manager of the implementing agency Wald and Corbe in Hügelheim, stressed that it was necessary to incorporate all present measures into the overall plan to reach the desired result.	Gregor Kühn, the manager of the programmed laboratory for the construction of the project in Hull, highlighted that it was necessary to fully understand the scheme of all the proposed measures to achieve the desired result.	Gregor Khoun, a specialist in the field of plant and animal design in Hedgefields, who proposed the project stressed the necessity to create the summation of all the proposed actions to achieve the desired result.	Gregor Kühn, Fachplaner des beauftragten Ingenieurbüros Wald und Corbe aus Hügelsheim, der das Konzept vorstellte, betonte, dass es das Zusammenspiel aller vorgestellten Maßnahmen benötige, um in der Summe das gewünschte Ziel zu erreichen.
1815	Besides this, the most economically viable solution was found, as in Joachim's Walden of Wald and Corbet.	The economic solution had to be found further down the line, so John Wald was forest and corb.	Further on, the economically viable solution was held to be found, such as Joachim Wald between forest and cork.	Darüber hinaus sei man gehalten die wirtschaftlichste Lösung zu finden, so Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
1816	Mute reignited in the Romans who, when they met again with normal events, once again persisted under a plague of imperialism.	Unmuted behavior was seen among those ancients who, in normal circumstances, were immersed in a sea of potential assets.	Unmuted were at the annals of the ancients who, even in normal times, were always struggling with a collapse of the canal network.	Unmut herrschte bei Anliegern des Altorts, die selbst bei normalen Gewitterregen immer wieder unter einer Überlastung des Kanalnetzes zu leiden haben.
1817	The problem is well known in the management and first measures have already been taken.	The problem is well-known in the administration and first steps were already taken.	The problem is known in the management department and first steps have already been taken.	Das Problem ist bei der Verwaltung bekannt und erste Maßnahmen wurden bereits ergriffen.
1818	However, some do insist that the guidelines for natural systems are different than those for high water protection and rioted to.	At least some people thought that the regulations for canals were different from those for high water protection and that they wouldn't be damaged.	But many chemists do not think that the regulations for canabal systems are different to those for high-pressure environments and should be maintained.	Häußler wies jedoch darauf hin, dass die Richtlinien für Kanalsysteme andere seien, als für den Hochwasserschutz und dies nicht vermischt werden dürfe.
1819	The community is obliged to set up the canal network in such a way that it can last two or three years.	The community was obliged to build the canal network so as to prevent the construction of several gullies.	The community is obliged to map the canal network so as to be able to deal with droughts that last for two to three years.	Die Gemeinde sei verpflichtet, das Kanalnetz so auszulegen, dass zwei- bis dreijährige Regenereignisse verkraftet werden könnten.
1820	The aquatic canopy much larger than human beings would disappear.	The surviving samples would be millions.	If the ocean was bigger, it would swallow billions.	Die Abwasserkanäle größer zu dimensionieren, würde Millionen verschlingen.

1824	In a dictionary, 'Dying in the Mean' is a psychological term describing a situation that varies in its feeling between seeing or experiencing a new situation.	Q : dna = meaning 'those' you are described in the Lexikon as having been to a new situation once before.	A sham or a psychological phenomenological form which is expressed in the way you feel when you have first encountered or seen a new situation.	Als Déjà Vu bezeichnet man laut Lexikon ein psychologisches Phänomen, das sich in dem Gefühl äußert, eine neue Situation schon einmal erlebt oder gesehen zu haben.
1825	In case of a similar visit to the Circle of Four at the Opal in the town centre, facing the farthest corner of the university's bay, it can't be left in a frenzied, percolatory atmosphere.	In case of visit to the same café on the corner in the round town cult across the area of the campus of the University of Rhein-Waal, it should not stand in the cold cellar of a mere dejà vu.	The visit of the same number of cafés along the city block in the direction to the University of Rhea, should it be possible, the rumour that this café's name might go on long in the middle of town.	Im Falle des Besuchs des gleichnamigen Cafés am Opschlag in der Kreisstadt Kleve in Sichtweite zur Hochschule Rhein-Waal muss es nicht beim reinen Déjà Vu-Gefühl bleiben.
1826	Finally, the café with the beautiful name really is to do something: not only in orderly, but by necessity, ready to go.	Finally, the café named after the lovely name has exactly achieved its aim: to make a real stay not only a pleasure but also one that can always be remembered back and forth.	In the end, the café with its beautiful name is exactly meant to achieve: To make a real holiday not only useful, but also something we are always regrettably having to do again and again.

Zwischen führenden Flugzeugherstellern ist es zu einer Auseinandersetzung über die Breite von Sitzen in der Touristenklasse bei Langstreckenflügen gekommen, was den Ton für einen bitteren Zusammenstoß auf der Dubai Airshow diesen Monat angibt.
1860	The conflict has its bearings round the seat width offered to passengers travelling long flights in the tourist class, which are not always those who seek to negotiate the prices of the aft flight companies; in this unusual space are the key for the negotiations to be made on the latest Airbus and Boeing engines.	The race shrinks the seat height in which the passengers offered long journeys in the tourist class is – not always the ones who, for the most part, seek to manage the airlines' overheads, but this highly dined space provides the keys for the competitive tenders offered by Airbus and Boeing on the latest aircraft.	The noise revolves around the width of the seat wide offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who're trying to find frequent flight time for themselves. However this newly-adopted space is equipped with the key for the efficiency claims of Airbus and Boeing against the latest airplanes designed by Airbus.	Der Streit dreht sich um die Sitzbreite, die Passagieren bei langen Flügen in der Touristenklasse angeboten wird – nicht immer diejenigen, um die sich Fluggesellschaften am meisten bemühen, doch dieser ausgewiesene Raum stellt den Schlüssel für die Effizienzbehauptungen bei den neuesten Flugzeugen von Airbus SAS und Boeing Co. dar.

November Rekordaufträge erwarten.
1863	How the back part of the plane is remodelled – specifically whether there are nine or ten seats – in these days, it's not important for the precise economic results reported that the new mini-Jumbo is supposed to deliver.	"How the back part of the plane is being shaped – specifically whether there are nine or ten seats — is decisive for the economic results reported on the new ""Mini-Jumbo"" design."	"How the back of the plane is shaped, particularly whether there are nine or ten seats, is vital for the economic results promised to the new ""Mini-Jumbo"" model."	"Wie der hintere Teil des Flugzeugs ausgestaltet ist – insbesondere ob es Reihen mit neun oder zehn Sitzen gibt –, ist entscheidend für die angegebenen wirtschaftlichen Ergebnisse, die das neue „Mini-Jumbo""-Design liefern soll."
1864	"Boeing claims that its modernized ""777"" seats 406 people in the traveling class, which is wide by over seventeen inches and given ten seats."	Boeing claims that its modernized 777 was designed to carry up to 463 passengers in the tour bus class, which is over 17 feet wide and allowed ten passengers.

"Boeing behauptet, seine modernisierte „777X"" fasse 406 Personen bei Sitzen in der Touristenklasse, die über 17 Zoll breit sind und so zehn pro Reihe erlauben."
1865	Airbus said that the recent version of A350 would transport 350 people in 18 passenger compartments in the class of tourists, although there are nine.	Airbus said the new version of A350 could accommodate 350 people in four wide seats in the family vacation cabin, although it's nine rows per row.	Airbus said that the current version of the A350 carried 350 people in eight rows in the touring class, even though it was nine in a row.	Airbus erklärt, die konkurrierende Version des A350 befördere 350 Personen in 18 Zoll breiten Sitzen in der Touristenklasse, wobei es neun pro Reihe gibt.

1869	Airbus engineered its long journeys to Siberian in seats, which are considered regional turboprops, says John Leahy, the manager of Airbus.	Eames-Airbus' John Leahy predicts short journeys in seats, though they are regional turboprops, says the vice-president of Airbus's operation.	Boeing is proposing to conduct long-haul flights in executive cabins, which are better than regional turboprops, says Airbus Manager John Leahy.	"„Boeing schlägt Langstreckenflüge in Sitzen vor, die enger sind als regionale Turbo-Props"", sagt Airbus-Vertriebschef John Leahy."
1870	Even though mankind's diets are changing, plane seats don't have dramatic changes.	People are getting thinner and more accustomed to changing diets, but plane seats haven't changed much.	People are getting thinner because of changes in their diets; however, seats on airplanes don't change at all.	Angesichts geänderter Ernährungsgewohnheiten werden die Leute dicker, doch Flugzeugsitze haben sich nicht radikal verändert.

1872	The average length of a man's body in the 21. century according to US-American health statistics is 1,8 cm.	According to the US-American medical association, the waist circumference of the median American man in the 21. century is about eight cm.	According to US-American health statistics, the average height of men in the 21st century is eight inches.	Der Taillenumfang des männlichen Durchschnittsamerikaners im 21. Jahrhundert beträgt laut US-amerikanischen Gesundheitsstatistiken 100,8 cm.
1873	"Airbus said that his rival was designed around a seating design from the 1950s, when the average body mass of the freshly-formed ""Jet Set"" was short."	"Airbus says his new model is based on a chair concept from the 1950s, when the average body mass of the freshly-assembled ""Jet Set"" was modest."	"Airbus says that its Rivale derives from a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body mass of the newly-wed ""Jet Set"" was 73.2%."

1875	Boeing disputes the number of seats from Airbus to the measurements and says it is not up to the manufacturer what airline sets to determine how airlines manage the balance between seat sizes and cabin configurations.	Boeing disputes the scale of Airbus's seats and says that it isn't in the best interest of the manufacturer how airlines balance their comfort and safety.	Boeing disputes the number of seats in Airbus's flight program and says it's not enough for the manufacturer to decide how airline cabins are balanced between seating.

1880	For travelers, there is more freedom of action and for the manufacturers a subject which can be applied on the scale of the scale.	For the aviation industry there is more freedom to fly and, for the manufacturers, it's a subject which can alter the rules more drastically.	The issue of removing skins in the equation is more important for airline passengers, but for manufacturers it will become a matter which can influence the rules in increasing numbers.	Für Fluggäste geht es um mehr Ellenbogenfreiheit, aber für Hersteller wird es in zunehmendem Maße ein Thema, das sich auf die Umsätze auswirken kann.
1881	In the back of the scene is a race between selected aircraft manufacturers and their volume estimates at least 700 billion US-dollars per minute for those next decade, which could have a substantial impact on the export value of the United States or Europe.	Behind the juxtaposition is a series of airshows with a forecast value of at least 700 billion US dollars for domestic products over the next decade, which could have a lasting impact on the export market of the USA or Europe.

Wie Reuters im Juli erstmals berichtete, ist das Sitzlayout die treibende Kraft hinter der Auseinandersetzung um die neuen Jets.
1883	Both Airbus and Boeing say they can achieve up to 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their new two-motory Langstreckenplanet, as the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER, which has just three seats.	Airbus and Boeing claim that they're saving a minimum of 20 percent on the cost of their new two-motoristic long distance models compared to the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER, which has a seat at 365.	Both Airbus and Boeing claim up to 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their new two-motorized plane than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.	Sowohl Airbus als auch Boeing behaupten 20 Prozent mehr Effizienz pro Sitz bei ihren neuesten zweimotorigen Langstreckendesigns als der Marktführer in diesem Segment, die 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER.
1884	The predictions made by Boeing in relation to the results vary considerably from the fact that the 777 with its ten seats is getting replaced by the original design of the original design of nine seats in the original.	The verdicts from the results vary a great deal on whether the 777 with its ten seats will be paired to the original design of nine seats in the original.	The predictions of Boeing based on the results in part on the assumption that the 777X with its ten seats is going to be replaced by the original design of the original design of nine seats in the 777.	Die Aussagen Boeings zu den Ergebnissen hängen teilweise davon ab, dass die 777X mit ihren zehn Sitzen pro Reihe mit dem Originaldesign von neun Sitzen in der 777 verglichen wird.
1885	Costs per unit increased by about ten seats, the current average.	The cost of a unit is still much lower than the current 12-seater machine.	The cost per unit increased further than the cost of today's ten seater machine.	Die gestiegenen Kosten pro Einheit sind immer noch geringer als bei derzeit verwendeten Maschinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe.
1886	"Because of the weight of his plane, it makes more likely to make our products competitive,"" says Kevin Keniston, vice-president for passenger comfort at Euroair."	By bashing his plane further makes it possible for them to compete with our own products, says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger and economy at European Airbus.	"So, he can't have more seats in his plane to make it competitively available"", says Kevin Keniston, vice-president of passenger comfort at European Airbus."	"„Boeing quetscht deshalb mehr Sitze in sein Flugzeug, um es wettbewerbsfähiger zu unseren Produkten zu machen"", sagt Kevin Keniston, Leiter für Passagierkomfort bei der europäischen Airbus."
1887	Similarly, analysts say that full Kabins with ten seats were likely to be placed in existing 777s, so there was a large number of passengers for the eventual arrangements to be drawn up in case of unforeseeable consequences.	Andererseits, analysts say full Kabinen with ten seats available on the present 777 conceded to having large numbers of passengers still to weigh in on the formula for the budget.	Andererseits, analysts say full Kabinen with ten seats in the existing 787s claim that there were many passengers who could vote for the single passenger arrangement, preferring to go on board billiger planes.	Andererseits sagen Analysten, volle Kabinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe bei vorhandenen 777s deuteten darauf hin, dass sich viele Passagiere für die engere Anordnung entschieden, was mit billigeren Flugtarifen einhergehen könnte.
1888	The offer of eighteen seats would make perfect sense for passengers, but in the practical realm, the ability to control the business environment through the 777,' says Mary Kirby, director of the Airbus Institute for Kabin and Graphics.	"Airbus carries out a whole host of seats at eighteen inches wide, but the practicality is as follows: from an economic viewpoint, the Airbus line-up that it was dominated by the Boeing 767 as a defensive option,"" says Mary Kirby, director of the American Express Centre for Kabinis and a founder of Runway Girl Network."	The width of eight toes would be great for passengers, but the practicality is such that the government's control over the airbus line at the A380 offsetting the cost of passenger seats, says Mary Kirby, an independent consultant at the Kabinen Association, cofounder and co-chairman of Runway Girl Network.	"„Achtzehn Zoll Sitzbreite wären toll für Passagiere, aber die Wirklichkeit ist: von einem wirtschaftlichen Gesichtspunkt aus ist das Airbus-Angebot von der Bedrohung durch die 777 gesteuert"", sagt Mary Kirby, Expertin für Kabineneinrichtung, Gründerin und Herausgeberin von Runway Girl Network."
1889	Airbus and Boeing aren't the only places they can visit, but a catalog of suppliers who can be sourced from the airline's website.	Airbus and Boeing don't offer seating, but a catalogue of suppliers which can be used to select flights.	Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but they do have a catalogue of suppliers from which to choose the airlines.	Airbus und Boeing bieten keine Sitze an, sondern einen Katalog von Zulieferern, aus denen die Fluggesellschaften auswählen können.
1890	The world's largest jet-stores are wearing even more fitting sizes to match the competition.	The world traveller jetpacks wear just the right size to match the merchandise on offer.	Almost all of the jet-setters look at themselves to judge their equipment against the competition.	Die weltreisenden Jet-Verkäufer tragen sogar Bandmaß bei sich, um die Einrichtung bei der Konkurrenz nachzumessen.
1891	Even though they're offering the comfort for a reasonable price, all airlines offer much more comfortable options for passengers and regional flights.	Even if they offer the convenience at a reasonable price, all manufacturers of jets offer such a low-cost variant for passenger and regional flights.	Even if they offer the comfort at a discount, all the operators provide airfares with attractive design for domestic and regional flights.	Selbst wenn sie den Komfort anpreisen, so bieten doch alle Hersteller auch Jets mit hochverdichteter Ausgestaltung für Billigfluglinien und regionale Flüge.
1892	Airbus is offering an A350 with ten seats, but according to its own statement, it hasn't yet sold out.	Airbus is offering an A350 with ten seats, but according to their own statement, hasn't yet sold any A350s.	Airbus is offering a sizeable plane, but according to its own reports, the plane has not yet been sold.	Airbus bietet einen A350 mit zehnsitzigen Reihen, hat aber laut eigener Aussage noch keinen verkauft.
1893	Airbus has argued that the ability of cabins to fold is important, and for some Jets wide seat options are offered.	Airbus said there was a brief emphasis on the need for more legroom in the cabins and some jets offered wide seats in the aisles.	Airbus has only recently emphasised how important it is to have wider seatbelts on some jets.	Bis vor kurzem hat Airbus betont, wie wichtig mehr Anpassbarkeit der Kabinen sei und für einige Jets breite Sitze an den Gängen angeboten.
1894	Without the support of any other manufacturers, great modern jets are expected to fail without the support of any other manufacturer. But the multitude of 777X purchases could be insufficient for such a new standard.	Without the support of only one other manufacturer, major modern jets say experts that their reputation will probably vanish for a new standard, but the volume of orders could be reduced by the number of 777X orders.	Many modern jets could not be built without the support of any other manufacturer, experts say. The reputation for a new branch standard may have diminished, but the number of British Airways customers could be reduced by the lack of airframes.	Ohne die Unterstützung des einzigen anderen Herstellers großer moderner Jets sagen Experten, dass der Ruf nach einem neuen Branchenstandard vermutlich verpuffen werde, aber von der Welle von 777X-Verkäufen ablenken könnte.
1895	Vegetarianism is, according to the Lexicon, the religion of vegetarianism, but in a very large way.

Der Veganismus ist laut Lexika dem Vegetarismus unterstellt, unterscheidet sich von diesem aber doch auf ganz erhebliche Weise.
1896	Carrots, which tend to grow the good taste of canaries, particularly nutmeg, shall not be served on a vegan diet.

Denn während Vegetarier sich den Verzehr von Sahnetorte, Eis oder einem kräftigen Edamer erlauben, stehen diese Schlemmereien nicht auf der Speisekarte eines Veganers.
1897	The vegan can choose from all the ingredients for animals and fish, except for ketchup.

1898	What remains remains to be wondered but, in closer examination, the vegan world is characterised by a beachgoing multiculturalist landscape.	What remains can be asked a lie, but when examined in more detail, the vegan world is characterised by a basic environmental consideration.	What remains can be asked any time, but closer examination the vegan world is characterised by a beachy mix.	Was bleibt, mag man sich fragen, doch bei näherer Betrachtung zeichnet sich die vegane Ernährungswelt durch einen beachtlichen Einfallsreichtum aus.
1899	A lot of vegans prefer dark trays to brown, says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the modern-day Reformatory.	Forty-one vegetarians are popular, says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the prestigious Reformatory which is making a large number of vegan recipes.	Baptism is a huge success, said Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the historic Reformatory, which provides a large number of vegan products.	"""Brotaufstriche sind sehr beliebt"", erklärt Ute Henkelmann, die Inhaberin des hiesigen Reformhauses, die eine Vielzahl spezieller Produkte für Veganer bereithält."
1900	As a matter of course, Reuben is happy to visit the shop in the dome.	Even Reuben Proctor likes visiting the shop in the Dome.	The grocery store in the Dome is popular, too.	Auch Reuben Proctor besucht den Laden in der Domgasse gerne.
1901	"Living vegan for 13 years in the heart of the New World Order, he works fast (and easily) everything that is needed to survive. ""In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian""."	"He's been living vegan for the last 13 years, he's finding (almost) everything he needs to live in Lampertheim. ""I cut my diet and became vegetarian in 1997."""	All of a sudden in 1997, the wealthy New Zealander raised his income and became vegetarian.	"Seit 13 Jahren lebt der gebürtige Neuseeländer vegan, in Lampertheim findet er (fast) alles vor, was er zum Leben braucht. ""1997 stellte ich meine Ernährung um und wurde Vegetarier""."
1902	When the century of the plague came afterward, and I became vegan.	Around the tenth of the century, the next step was adopted: I became a vegan.	When the century turned out, the next step was to become vegan.	Um die Jahrhundertwende erfolgte dann der nächste Schritt und ich wurde Veganer.
1903	'The evidence came not only because of the diet but also because of the shoe choice, says Proctor, an art professor who sews normal leather.	"The proof came not only from food, but mainly because of the shoe choice,"" says Proctor, the artist who dyed the normal leather."	"The evidence came not only because of the diet, but rather because of the shoe choice,"" said Proctor, who was painting normal leather."	"""Die Überzeugung kam aber nicht nur wegen der Ernährung, sondern aufgrund der Schuhwahl"", sagt Proctor, der Kunstleder normalem Leder vorzieht."
1904	He realized that there was also a range of things that weren't strictly animal-based.	He realized that there were other daily needs without orphanage products.	He realized that there are other forms of everyday food, which include animal products.	Er erkannte, dass es auch in anderen alltäglichen Belangen ohne tierische Produkte geht.

"""Ich will nicht, dass Tiere für mich sterben müssen"", spricht Proctor die Maxime der Veganer aus, die sich auf das gesamte Konsumverhalten erstreckt."
1907	Whether it was burgers, rice cakes or gumballs behind closed doors, vegans quickly discovered whole new products that helped to increase the appetite.	In short, the vegan quickly discovered nearly entirely new products which took offence to the beginnings.	Whether it be burgers, curryed eggs or gum biscuits, the vegan quickly discovered all new products, where the craving was for the latter.	Statt Burgern, Rühreiern oder Gummibären hinterherzutrauern, habe der Veganer schnell ganz neue Produkte entdeckt, die Begeisterung stieg an.
1908	Today, a double bonus says Proctor that vegans aren't necessarily bad at all, nor is asking an animal food either. The assumption that one may choose between a diet and eating options makes PROctor rise more and further off his plate.	"It's a double bonus,"" says Proctor today, ""but after this vegan isn't necessarily a vegetarian, no aspirin; it's a meaty thing"", makes Proctor reconsider the choice of what his diet should be."	The addition of a vegetable, in keeping with the eating plan, keeps Proctor back on his feet.	"""Es ist ein doppelter Bonus"", sagt Proctor heute, ""tatsächlich stellt vegan sein keinen Verzicht, keine Askese dar, sondern es ist eine Bereicherung"". Die Annahme, dass man mit der Ernährungsumstellung die Auswahl an Speiseoptionen reduziere, führt Proctor eher auf die Macht der Gewohnheit zurück."
1909	And precisely these conditions made certain attempts as good as that.	And exactly these adaptations made certain attempts as good as those others were.	And precisely these changes were making some even more vicious attempts.	Und genau diese Konditionierungen ließen auch manchen noch so gut gemeinten Versuch scheitern.
1910	The factor of the number is a very important factor to consider, which can happen many quickly, similarly to smoking, providing a comparison.	The factor of the meaning is a completely different factor that can be done quite easily, such as in cigarettes, making Proctor a comparison.	The search factor is a much-important factor that can be effected quickly, similar to smoking, says Proctor.	"""Der Suchtfaktor ist ein ganz entscheidender Faktor, der viele schnell aufgeben lässt, ähnlich wie beim Rauchen"", stellt Proctor einen Vergleich auf."
1911	"And says that: ""Better-looking mice are not on the animal""."	"And throws up: ""Bestimmt lizards aren't festive to the animals."""	"And ends with the following: ""Best-sellers aren't for your trade."""	"Und wendet ein: ""Bestimmte Geschmäcker sind nicht am Tier festzumachen""."
1912	It is often the flavors of food or the way of cooking that sets the mood.	It is often the flavors or the cooking that create the flavour.	It is often the recipes or the way to make them that changes the taste.	Oft sind es die Gewürze oder die Art der Zubereitung, die den Geschmack ausmachen.
1913	"""You can have the same effect on other than in one way,"" exaggerated a vegan."	'But you can produce the same effect on other, very easily said the vegan.	You can also produce the same effect in another way, wrote the vegan.	"""Man kann aber auch auf andere Weise den gleichen Effekt erzeugen"", verdeutlicht der Veganer."
1914	A grilling party brings a selection of vegetables, including aubergines, cactuses and vegans.	Proctor adds eggplant, carrots and vegan cheese to a barbecue.

Er achtet auf eine ausgewogene, abwechslungsreiche Ernährung, bei der es durchaus auch einmal deftig schmecken soll.
1916	A bit of tooth may have had something between the teeth, but it's legal.	Of course there are teeth between those which have an idea.	There is something somewhere between the teeth, which is proper.	Natürlich möchte man etwas zwischen den Zähnen haben, das ist legitim.
1917	"It's supposed to pelt, but this is not only about animal food,"" said Proctor."	It is supposed to mask, but that's not just as a recipe for making cookies, said Proctor.	"It is meant to famine, but it's not just going to reduce food in animal forms,"" said Proctor."	"""Es soll schmecken, aber das ist nicht nur auf tierische Nahrung zu reduzieren"", so Proctor."
1918	He didn't suffer any health problems, from an ailment to an overdose, which was another widespread misconception.	Judging from the incidence of asbestos to strewth, a further large proportion of his wounds haven't been done.	Health problems before reaching an adequacy, which is another wide-ranging concern, have not been addressed.	Gesundheitliche Schäden bis hin zu Essstörungen, eine weitere weitverbreitete Annahme, habe er nicht erlitten.

My blood counts are good, I often go to the doctor's.	"""Meine Blutwerte sind bestens, ich lasse mich oft checken"", verrät Proctor."
1923	A lot of vegans who are consuming vitamin B12, especially in the presence of mangels, are at risk for taking vitamin B12.	According to the WHO, many vegans are taking vitamin B12 as a preservative.	Especially in the form of vitamin B12, many vegans warn against ghee.	Insbesondere vor dem Mangel an Vitamin B12 warnen viele Vegansimus-Kritiker.
1924	A little protein containing dairy products, in the form of which they are cooked, is doubtful whether the meat you buy has the vitamins B12 and B12.	"For example, animals which are fed on animal fat are subject to disease but only mildly in their manner of eating, he concludes, ""whether the meat eaten in the fridge is high in vitamin-B12..."	As animals that need frying will end up being coloured, rather than putting them on the skin, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy get the vitamin B12-acids high, says Proctor.	"""Da Tiere mit Futtermitteln genährt werden, statt auf der Weide zu grasen, ist es fraglich, ob in dem Fleisch, das man in der Kühltruhe kauft, der Vitamin-B12-Anteil hoch ist"", findet Proctor."
1925	For vegans, it's possible to take the powder in form of tablets.	For vegans, the possibility of taking the vitamin in form of tablets offers great opportunity.

1928	There are widespread products ranging from lotions to gums, and all supermarkets now have soaps and other drinks.	It's everywhere there are basic ingredients and every supermarket now has so called soaps and other products.	There's organic food everywhere and almost every supermarket now has so-called soft drinks and other products.	Grundnahrungsmittel gibt es schließlich überall und jeder Supermarkt hat mittlerweile Sojamilch und andere Produkte.

1931	"Few people realize that just fermenting products are expensive, but it does seem the same for so many ""traditional"" fermenting products""."

1932	Withouthin, preparing vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than it used to be.	The preparation of vegan food is much cheaper and less time consuming than making them.	Without doing this, making vegan meals is much cheaper and less time-consuming than taking them as a meal.	Ohnehin sei die Zubereitung veganer Gerichte weitaus günstiger und weniger zeitaufwendig, als gemeinhin angenommen.
1933	"There are a lot of things to discover in the kitchen, and with a few small knives one can be good, but not quite perfect results,"" says Proctor."	There is a great deal of discovery in the house, you can make good, but not much better by using a few small knives, says Proctor.	There's a lot of discovery in the house, and with a few small knives can be good, but not exactly better, says Proctor.	"""In der Hausküche gibt es viel zu entdecken, mit ein paar kleinen Kniffen kann man gute, wenn nicht teilweise bessere Ergebnisse erzielen"", sagt Proctor."
1934	The substitution of butter for butter and carbonate instead of oats, combined with the baking of his vegan cheesecake, could bring his paneerel to a boil.	Margarine instead of butter, a little more sugar and carbon dioxide than proctor's vegan cheesecakes could turn into hair dryers.	Margarine instead of butter, a bit more sugar and Kohlensäure alternatively to apples, proctor's vegan cheesecake could turn into jams too.	Margarine statt Butter, etwas mehr Backpulver und Kohlensäure statt Ei, mit seinen veganen Käsekuchen konnte Proctor auch seine Schwiegereltern zum Staunen bringen.

1936	Having Dynamity when you cook together makes that a new position.	That's got dynamic when people cook together, so it's a new level.	It has dynamic, if you cook it together, has a new meaning.	Das hat Dynamik, wenn man zusammen kocht, hat das einen neuen Stellenwert.
1937	The situations which may arise as a result of this are the same from which people actually live, said Proctor.	The situations that could arise from this are as different to the people themselves, says Proctor.	The circumstances that arise because of it are as different as the people themselves, says Proctor.	"""Die Situationen, die dabei entstehen können, sind so unterschiedlich wie die Menschen selbst"", sagt Proctor."
1938	Of course he was already helped to get rid of scleptis, and even a stain was brought up.	Of course he was already cured of skepticism, but also the disease was successfully stopped.	Of course, he was already treated for scolioses, however.	Natürlich wurde ihm aber auch schon Skepsis entgegengebracht.
1939	Don't you eat my food anymore?	Don't you eat my food any more?	Don't you eat my food anymore?	Schmeckt dir mein Essen nicht mehr?
1940	Do you want me to feel bad now because I drink milk? These kinds of questions require anaesthetic from a vegan with fingertips.	Do you want me to feel bad now because I drink milk? To answer such questions in a way it is hard to be a vegan.	"Do you want me to feel bad now because I drink milk? ""These are some questions you have to ask yourself as vegans with fingers firmly planted."""	"""Soll ich mich jetzt schlecht fühlen, weil ich Milch trinke?"" - bei solcherlei Fragen müsse man als Veganer mit Fingerspitzengefühl agieren."
1941	"I don't want to shame people, i'm part of this company"". Proctor says ""I won't insult anybody, I don't want to commit any crime against anyone""."	"I am not ashamed of people, I am part of this society,"" says Proctor no formal explanation."	"I don't condemn people. I'm part of this society"", says Proctor."	"""Ich lehne die Menschen ja nicht ab, ich bin Teil dieser Gesellschaft"", möchte Proctor kein Enklavendasein fristen."
1942	In more detail, the daily world isn't as exotic as you think it is - and the vegan might not be as restricted in everyday as most people think it is.	And in more detail, the everyday world is not quite as vegan as we think it is. The vegan should not be restricted to things he or she might consider natural.	It then happens not to appear as vegan-friendly as suggested - and vegans aren't allowed to be in the everyday as they might seem.	Und genauer betrachtet erscheint die Alltagswelt dann gar nicht so veganfremd wie vermutet - und der Veganer nicht so im Alltag eingeschränkt wie gemeinhin angenommen.
1943	Even fast food is allowed.	Fast food is allowed, too.	Likewise, fast food is allowed.	Auch Fast Food ist erlaubt.
1944	There are pizzas everywhere!	There are some pies everywhere.	There are loads of potatoes everywhere!	Pommes gibt es überall!

1946	He will eat pasta at a pizzeria, or he can just order a pizza without cheese, that is a matter of habit.	He might wish for pasta dishes in a pizzeria, or order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of domicile.	He often eats pasta in a pizzeria, or he just buys a pizza without cheese, all a matter of law.	In einer Pizzeria weicht er auf Pastagerichte aus, oder bestellt eben eine Pizza ohne Käse, alles eine Frage der Gewohnheit.
1947	The restaurants are responding so slowly.	The restaurants are eating so slowly.	The restaurants are taking it slow.	Die Restaurants stellen sich so langsam darauf ein.
1948	"When I began to eat vegan 13 years ago, it was much more complicated in the new world. ""You have to be careful with people talking about that."""	"When I started to eat vegan 13 years ago, it was much more difficult for the Newsees to do anything. ""I have to learn how to make people talk and they're paid attention to that."""	"When I started to eat vegan when I was thirteen years old, it was still much more difficult to eat vegan when you were a newster."" Man must make sense of the people talking, they're paying attention to this."	"""Als ich vor 13 Jahren angefangen habe, mich vegan zu ernähren, war alles noch viel schwieriger"", kann der Neuseeländer eine Entwicklung ausfindig machen: ""Man muss mit den Leuten reden, sie darauf aufmerksam machen""."
1949	When there are plenty of questions, they might consider adding the menu, he hopes.	While there are plenty of requests for us to add the menu, he hopes they might be willing to do so.	"If enough questions come in, perhaps they will add the menu to theirs"", he hopes."	"""Wenn genügend Nachfragen kommen, sind sie vielleicht dazu geneigt, die Speisekarte zu ergänzen"", hofft er."

1953	Anyone can eat it, but they are also the opposite of exclusivity.	You can eat it any time. They are also exactly the opposite of regular meal.	They can eat everyone, but they are more expensive than others.	Jeder kann sie essen, sie sind also genau das Gegenteil von exklusiv.
1954	"Foods are exclusive, in the literal sense of the word, but they separate others"", said Proctor."	"""Floral meat dishes are almost exclusive, in the true sense of the word, but they're cloying others"", says Proctor."	"Fine dining dishes are not included in this list, but in the very true sense of the word, because they close other ones,"" says Proctor."

1955	"Wherever man wants to avoid food poisoning, veganism is a sure way to make the largest part of it impossible to eat raw,"" says Proctor."	"When you want to prevent foodstuffs, then veganism is an indispensable way of making a lot of them practically impossible,"" says Proctor."	When you don't want to avoid food chain soda, then veganism is an inevitable way to make the smallest part of it impossible to cook without doing it, says Proctor.	"""Wenn man Lebensmittelskandale vermeiden will, dann ist Veganismus ein sicherer Weg, den allergrößten Teil von vornherein unmöglich zu machen"", sagt Proctor."
1956	But buying vegan food can be a bit difficult at the beginning.	There's perhaps something more difficult to buy vegan food when starting out.	It may be difficult to buy vegan products at the beginning.	Der Einkauf veganer Produkte könne aber zu Beginn etwas schwierig sein.
1957	Even if we learn to understand that in an earthly manner tieric additives can contain pigments, it seems obvious to reject the practice of setting up and choosing a fortify among such a number of hill and fall alike.	If one learns to understand that tertiary additives in soils can be found in many herbaceous plants and they are easy to remove with the appropriate age and cultural variation in the earth's path when there are so many hills and valleys to visit, the gradual evolution of the epheric path at such a rapid rate is apparent.	Particularly when you learn to understand the fact that in potatoes and other crops contain extra-tasting additives, they appear to be a material of such importance that humans should take courage when they settle on a steep slope with so many hills and falls alike.	Insbesondere wenn man zu verstehen lernt, das auch in Erdnüsse tierische Zusatzstoffe als Farbgeber enthalten seinen können, scheint man mit der Befolgung der Ethik bei so vielen Hürden und Fallen schnell der Mut zu verlassen.
1958	"Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book entitled ""Veganetarian: Vegetarian Contents, Plant and Animal Element New Products"", which describes the full spectrum of ingredients being used to make foods, but also cleaning agents."	"Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book entitled: ""Veganity - Technical and chemical substances in food and cooking"" explaining the many ingredients used to make food, but also cleaning agents."	"Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book ""Veganesimo - The bio-chemical and biological components of the food chain"" explaining the many chemical reactions that can be added to foods, but also cleaning agents."	"Nicht nur deshalb haben Reuben Proctor und Lars Thomsen ein Buch geschrieben: ""Veganissimo - Tierische Inhaltsstoffe und ihre Alternativen"" erklärt die vielen Inhaltsstoffe, die Nahrungs- aber auch Reinigungsmitteln beigesetzt werden."
1959	"Having opened a scanner and knowing which symbols and logos you should look for sometimes, it's better to go small steps instead of staying in silence or to yell,"" says Proctor."	"Even after they've developed a scanner, who knows which symbols and logos to choose is sometimes better to have small steps to do than to stand still or to be lost,"" says William."	"Once you have started to scan for a scan and realize what is meant to be noted on which sign or logos are ""often better small steps to take than being stifled or to be abandoned"", says Proctor."	"""Nach und nach entwickelt man einen Scannerblick und weiß, auf welche Zeichen und Logos man zu achten hat ""Es ist manchmal besser kleine Schritte zu tun als stehenzubleiben oder zu stolpern"", weiß Proctor."
1960	Veganism is an important moral sensibility which focuses on consciousness.	Vegetarianism is a morally important tool which works in the direction of consciousness.	Against Veganism, it is an important moral indicator to the consciousness.	Der Veganismus, er ist ein wichtiger moralischer Fingerzeig, der auf das Bewusstsein schlägt.
1961	He may not quite be able to abstract his personal interests, but perhaps he can explain to the consumers why their own living conditions are difficult to understand.	He may not quite get his living, but at least he can convince the people to ask what his habits are.	Maybe he doesn't quite get his house divided up; but at least he can convince the consumers to question his own habits.	Vielleicht schafft er es nicht ganz, dass man seine Gewohnheiten ablegt, doch zumindest kann er den Konsumenten lehren, seine Gewohnheiten kritisch zu hinterfragen.
1962	Bayern's first team but especially after the second half are optimistic.	Bayern's basketball team did the first half of the second leg an optimistically minded side.	Bayern's first team lost 3-2.	Bayerns Basketballer trotz erster Niederlage optimistisch
1963	Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not prove the enormous optimism that played out in the soccer team Bayern Munich.	Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not dampen the immense optimism of the FC Bayern Munich team.	Even after losing the first game of the Euroleague in the U.S.A.T.B. Bayern Munich's juggernaut could not dampen the enormous optimism that had been built upon the United States and Europe as an athlete for young people.	Selbst die erste Niederlage in der Euroleague konnte bei den Basketballern des FC Bayern München den riesigen Optimismus nicht schmälern.
1964	"No one can convince us to believe the best team Europe has ever won in the past two years,"" celebrated Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic, a truly unhappy 83:88 (39:47) on Donnersday night at Olympic Stadium."	"No one can prevent us from believing the best team Europa two past five years,"" bilansked Bayern-Coach Svetlana Pesic after the disappointing 83:88 (39:47) victory at the Copa America title defenceman Olympiakos Pirosi on Sunday night."	"Somebody can convince us to believe that the best team Europa has won in the past two years"", sworn Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic in an unhappy 83:88 (39.47) win over the titleverteer Olympiakos Piräus on Saturday night."	"""Niemand kann uns verbieten daran zu glauben, auch gegen das beste Team Europas der vergangenen beiden Jahre zu gewinnen"", bilanzierte Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic nach dem unglücklichen 83:88 (39:47) am Donnerstagabend bei Titelverteidiger Olympiakos Piräus."

1966	When they only contested their third successive entry into the European Cup in the fifth century, the prizemoney were still not enough to be decided in the final round.	The competition in the European kingsmen proved very good in their first appearance in the literary world, but were unsatisfactory enough to satisfy the early voting cast.	After their third successive appearance in the European Royal Academy, the Monchens were selling for a long time, but were simply not well-represented in the decisive phase.	Bei ihrem erst dritten Auftritt in der europäischen Königsklasse verkauften sich die Münchner lange sehr gut, waren in den entscheidenden Phasen aber einfach nicht abgeklärt genug.
1967	The guests, while playing the art piece of 15-cup tea preparing for tomorrow, wanted to turn the game round again. One wall broke into the match during which the tie finished at eight:00.	The guests achieved the workpiece, a 15-pound-cup roll before being rearranged 13 minutes before leaving, giving an equally long reign for the game.	The guests finally made their art masterpiece, a 15-piece-sack lunch 13 minutes before the end of the game wrapped in a curtain ending, although a spoon fell from the end of the game again.	Die Gäste schafften zunächst das Kunststück, einen 15-Punkte-Rückstand 13 Minuten vor Schluss noch in eine Führung umzuwandeln, ehe Piräus dem Spiel erneut eine Wende gab.
1968	"We fought back inexcusably against the previous two competitions for the Euroleague, but then again made slight errors,"" said Bayern boss Yassin Idbihi."

"""We have endured the second-largest European cup since then, but then again made minor mistakes"", said manager Yassin Idbihi, a Bayern captain."	"""Wir haben uns unglaublich zurückgekämpft gegen den zweimaligen Euroleague-Champion, aber dann wieder leichtsinnige Fehler gemacht"", sagte Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi."
1969	We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.	We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.	We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.	Wir sind stolz auf unsere Leistung, aber wir wollen jedes Spiel gewinnen.

The Treasury have reduced the CGT payable proviso in advance, but further warning is needed to the absolving decision of the Treasury secretary George Osborne, who imposed a stamp duty of 7% on apartments which cost more than two million pounds and an annual allowance for buyers who didn't think of the apartment as a company or individual.

"In „Double Down"" wird behauptet, Daley habe an der Spitze der Bemühungen gestanden, Biden trotz ihres „engen, persönlichen Verhältnisses"" auszutauschen, ehe man sich schließlich gegen einen solchen Schachzug entschied, nachdem die Daten zeigten, dass die Kandidatur Clintons „die Chancen Obamas nicht maßgeblich verbessern"" würde."

2880	"I mentioned a whole range of things that one ought to consider, and that was one of them,"" said Daley in the magazine."	"""I considered a whole range of things to consider, and this was just one of them"", explained the magazine's founder."	I talked about a whole range of things that could be considered in consideration, and there was one of them, said the magazine's cover.	"„Ich äußerte eine ganze Reihe von Dingen, die man in Erwägung ziehen sollte, und das war eines davon"", erklärte Daley dem Magazin."
2881	"I recall that the president had so many furious questions at the time, and reminded ourselves: ""Does God want us to do?"""	"I recall that the President asked for some furious questions at the time. We answered, ""Doing God want us to?"""	It is enough to remind us that the president had left a lot of controversial questions at that time, so let's say what are we, do God willing?	"Man muss sich in Erinnerung rufen, dass der Präsident damals furchtbare Umfragewerte hatte, also dachten wir: „Um Gottes Willen, was machen wir?"""
2882	"While Dobbins described the debate as ""unfounded terror"" while running for a second term at the polling station, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable expense had been expended during the campaign to determine whether a ticket would pay its way through the polling booths."	While the ‘manufacturers' were deemed to be present at the moment, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that while the campaign for the election was much more laborious, he said, it was not clear whether a local election roll-out would result in a similar payout once voters had turned up.	"While the qualifiers for ""enough futile"" were also termed as ""unfounded,"" Martin told Anderson Cooper on CNN that during the campaign for the election had considerable effort been put in to determine if a candidate could pay such an increase in the number of candidates."	"Während Daley die Untersuchungen als „gebotene Sorgfalt"" bezeichnete, sagte Martin gegenüber Anderson Cooper von CNN, dass während der Kampagne für die Wiederwahl erheblicher Aufwand betrieben worden sei, um herauszufinden, ob ein solcher Zug sich im Hinblick auf die Wahlurnen auszahle."
2883	The cost of asking and answering questions won't go down as much in campaigns as in actual campaign spending, explained Martin on AC360.	If you don't really think about things, you won't get as much money in campaigns.	"There's not so much money for campaigns and research groups when there's no serious thinking on something,"" explained Martin on AC360."	"„In Kampagnen wird nicht so viel Geld für Umfragen und Fokusgruppen ausgegeben, wenn man nicht ernsthaft über etwas nachdenkt"", erklärte Martin auf AC360."
2884	It's not clear if Obama knew that his team was planning on doing an exchange.	It isn't clear to say if Obama knew his team was about to discuss an exchange.	However, it's not clear whether Obama knew that his team was planning to speak through an exchange.	Es ist allerdings nicht klar, ob Obama wusste, dass sein Team über einen Austausch nachdachte.
2885	Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his damian boss had known the potentially controversial switch.	Martin told CNN he had asked Daley whether his damian boss had known about the potent change.	Martin told CNN he wondered whether his damian boss had known the potent change.	Martin sagte gegenüber CNN, er habe Daley gefragt, ob sein damaliger Boss über den potenziellen Wechsel Bescheid gewusst hätte.
2886	Even though Daley explained that he didn't think the president of any possible change was aware, the previous columnist said that he thought it was possible for him to have known about this.	"While Daley said that he didn't think the president of the possible change ""since there was any chance"", the former cabinet secretary said Obama knew about it being possible."	Although Daley said that he didn't think that the president of the possible change had known, the old tabloid Stabschef admitted that he knew at one time or another that Obama knew about it.	"Wenngleich Daley erklärte, er glaube nicht, dass sich der Präsident der möglichen Veränderung „bewusst war"", gab der frühere Stabschef zu, es sei „möglich"" gewesen, dass Obama davon gewusst habe."
2887	Martin further argued that there was no definitive answer to the question, whether the political discussions over the Budget had brought about the negotiation of Obama's reshuffle.	"Martin added that ""Double down"" was not a definitive answer to the question whether the political divisions President Obama reached at the White House on Wednesday."	Martin added that he didn't have a definitive answer to the question unless the political negotiations at Obama's conference had ended in vain.	"Martin fügte hinzu, dass „Double Down"" keine definitive Antwort auf die Frage liefere, ob die politischen Sondierungen Obamas Schreibtisch erreicht hätten."
2888	Cooper asked Martin if he actually thought that Obama knew nothing about the research on whether to let Biden win the election.	Cooper asked Martin whether he thought seriously that Obama knew nothing from the fact that an election was supposed to involve Biden in the elections.	Cooper asked Martin whether he thought seriously that Obama didn't know anything about the studies to vote on Biden.	Cooper fragte Martin, ob er ernsthaft denke, Obama habe nichts von den Untersuchungen darüber gewusst, ob man Biden bei den Wahlen fallen lassen solle.
2889	"""Molly,"" he answered."	It was fitting, he said to Martin.	"""Goodbye"", he assured Martin."	"„Möglich"", erwiderte Martin."

Every time the council meets about budgets, Mayor Ralph Gerrard laughs well.	Immer wenn es in Gemeinderatssitzungen um den Haushalt geht, hat Bürgermeister Ralph Gerster gut lachen.
2892	The town store in Herdwick is well stocked, and the community's administration has not yet paid any attention since 2005.	The parish store in Shepherd's Wood has been well-stocked and the administration hasn't been seeing a staff member since 2005.	The Yeoman church in Herdwangen-Schöne is well stocked and the administration has not been active since 2005.	Das Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach ist gut gefüllt und Schulden kennt die Verwaltung bereits seit 2005 nicht mehr.
2893	Even the budget year 2012 can be regarded as a complete success in this respect.	Even the fiscal year 2012 can be regarded as a full success.	Even the fiscal year 2012 can be described as a full success in this respect.	Auch das Haushaltsjahr 2012 kann in diesem Sinne als voller Erfolg verbucht werden.
2894	This was clearly shown in the beginning of the year's financial report for 2012.	This became clear when the financial picture for 2012 was presented.	This was clearly evident when the cost of living for 2012 was presented.	Dies wurde bei der Vorstellung der Jahresrechnung für 2012 deutlich.
2895	As Andrea Rothmund explained, the budget for the administration was increased by about 7,000 euros over one million euros planned.	And as Andrea Rothmund explained, the cost of living in the administration building was expected to be about 6.5 million euros more than originally thought.	As Andrea Rothmund explained, the budget for the year ending June 30th was a mere euro above the budget.	Wie Andrea Rothmund erläuterte, sei der Verwaltungshaushalt mit rund 7,6 Millionen Euro über eine Millionen Euro höher ausgefallen als geplant.
2896	Even the amount of the budget deficit passed the € 8,5 million mark at the end of the day.	Even the surplus of the budget was about eight million euros – amounted to around one million euro for the year.	Even the cost of the budget came down to about eight million euro over the figure.	Auch der Überschuss des Verwaltungshaushaltes liege mit etwa 1,8 Millionen Euro rund eine Millionen Euro über dem Ansatz.
2897	To be thankful are the all-exchange rates and the lower VAT on the council taxation of the town.	To be thankful was the increase in the income tax, particularly the smaller contributions made to the municipal levy.	To be grateful, were the lower income tax and the community allowance for the income tax.	Zu verdanken sei der Überschuss vor allem höheren Gewerbesteuereinnahmen und dem Gemeindeanteil an der Einkommenssteuer.
2898	Even the financial ceiling remained well above the planned value.	Even the balance of assets remained well above the planned value.	Even the benchmark investment rate lags clear over the planned target.	Auch der Vermögenshaushalt lag wieder deutlich über den geplanten Werten.

The planned 1.5 million euros went to 2,5 million euro the year before.	Statt der vorgesehenen 1,5 Millionen Euro betrug er im vergangenen Jahr 2,5 Millionen Euro.
2900	It is suggested that this corresponds to the extra budget of the management budget, as it were at the time of writing.	This is, in my opinion, an increase in receipts of the administration budget, so Rothmund.	"""That's connected primarily to the higher rate of spending on the pension,"" Rothmund claims."	"""Dies liegt im Wesentlichen an der höheren Zuführung aus dem Verwaltungshaushalt"", so Rothmund."
2901	As more investment in 2012 was put into the budget than originally planned, the cost of raising the debt is higher.	In the budget year 2012, there were fewer investments than planned, so the cost of turnaround was higher.	Because less investment was made in budgetary year 2012 than planned, the budget for this year's budget was also higher.	Da im Haushaltsjahr 2012 weniger Investitionen als geplant getätigt worden sind, ist auch die Rücklagenzuführung höher ausgefallen.
2902	Overall, the general budget could be increased by around 1.2 million euros onwards.	Overall the general return could be increased by about 2 million euros to almost four million euro now.	Overall, the overall budget was boosted by around 2.1 million euro to all of nine millions euros.	Insgesamt konnte die allgemeine Rücklage um rund 2,1 Millionen Euro auf jetzt insgesamt 4,9 Millionen Euro gesteigert werden.

2905	He and the council were happy to hear the good numbers.	He and the council seemed pleased with the good numbers.	He and the village board were pleased to see the good numbers.	Er und die Gemeinderäte freuten sich sichtlich über die guten Zahlen.
2906	Though paradoxes exist, sadly these good figures could soon be dear to the citizens.	The paradox seems to not really make sense, but exactly these good numbers could easily be used by the people soon.	It seems paradoxical to think that very good numbers could soon cost the taxpayer.	Es mag paradox klingen, doch genau diese guten Zahlen könnten die Bürger bald teuer zu stehen kommen.
2907	The council was able to avoid high costs during the past because of the good finances.	The community was able to avoid high cost of living because of the good budget in the past.	The village could afford high taxes a few years ago through the good finances.	Durch die gute Finanzlage konnte die Gemeinde in der Vergangenheit auf hohe Hebesätze verzichten.
2908	That has resulted in another round of robbery, but regular gossip has claimed that a few people have killed goats.	Although this has happened again, many people have already dragged apples from the countryside.	This time, many a stranger has taken their supper away from country to country.	Dadurch wiederum seien aber laut Gerster schon öfters Zuschüsse vom Land gekürzt worden.
2909	There are several conditions to these sandwiches made from different sub-strategic materials.	There are several requirements for these tones made of diverse materials.	There are conditions for these particular and different types of pizzas.	Für diese Zuschüsse aus diversen Ausgleichsstöcken gibt es Voraussetzungen.

2911	The subject of regulations must be discussed, as in the coming years there will be investments that we would like to make more confident of.	The subject of trebles needs to be taken, as must we look at them, for in the future years we will require some investment, is said a spokesman in this regard.	We've got to consider the subject of budgets because in the future there'll be more investments that we would like to invest in, said a senior adviser in this context.	"""Das Thema Hebesätze müssen wir uns anschauen, da in den kommenden Jahren Investitionen anstehen, für die wir gerne Zuschüsse hätten"", kündigte Gerster in diesem Zusammenhang an."

I remember the great and varied things that Obama achieved, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, the end of the unjustified detention of homosexuality in the military, and the killing of Osama.

2938	I think that the campaign against political dictatures has resulted in too many killings to bring forward: constitutional reform, open access to health insurance and Guantanamo Bay settlements, among others.

2941	The republican blockade can't explain the reason why the abduction of foreign nationals is illegal or why convicted children are murdered by poisoning.	The republican blockade policy cannot explain why the use of foreign parliaments in remote areas or deaths of innocent children who are tortured by murder and trespass.	The republican blocade cannot explain why it is hard to tolerate foreign sovereigns or the murder of innocent children caused by murder.	Die republikanische Blockadepolitik kann nicht erklären, weshalb man das Abhören ausländischer Staatsoberhäupter zulässt oder die Tötung unschuldiger Kinder durch Drohnen in Übersee.
2942	It can't be explained why the National Security Agency gathers information about American life and why whistleblowers are being caught doing improbable acts.	It can't be explained why the National Security Agency gathers data on American private life and why whistleblowers are being urged to commit misdemeanour.	It is not clear why the National Security Agency collects information on the private lives of American citizens, and why whistleblowers are being sacked who commit misconduct.	Es kann nicht erklären, weshalb die National Security Agency Daten über das Privatleben von Amerikanern sammelt und warum Whistleblower bestraft werden, die staatliches Fehlverhalten offenlegen.
2943	How can't it be explained why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen murdered without the need for trial, or how the public borrowing and expenditure limits are set during the presidential election.	It cannot be explained why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-American citizen murdered without any procedure, nor why the public funding and expenditure limit have been extended during presidential elections.	Why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-American citizen murdered without using any trial, or why the public budget and expenditure limits were increased during presidential elections.	Es kann nicht erklären, weshalb Anwar al-Awlaki, ein US-amerikanischer Staatsbürger, ohne Verfahren ermordet wurde, noch weshalb die öffentlichen Finanzierungs- und Ausgabegrenzen während der Präsidentschaftswahlen umgangen werden.
2944	"There aren't the results of a report rightly divided; in other words, the efforts of the white house to transform the media is amongst the most violent since the Nixon regime."""	"The results of a report are not final: for the time being, the measures taken by the white house to reform the media were the most violent since the Nixon administration""."	"According to the report's results are not valid; rather, the practices at the White House for the Public Relating to the media are the ""aggressiveest... since the Nixon Administration""."	"Es rechtfertigt nicht die Ergebnisse eines Berichts, in dem es heißt, die Anstrengungen des Weißen Hauses zur Ruhigstellung der Medien seien die „aggressivsten ... seit der Nixon-Regierung""."
2945	And no young man can deny the inability to erect a simple website in three years since the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.	Neither can it be sworn that the website created three years after the Affordable Care Act's been adopted.	It's not the least bit of the incapacity made to create such an easy website for more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was abolished.	Und jüngstens kann es nicht die Unfähigkeit entschuldigen, in den mehr als drei Jahren seit der Verabschiedung des Affordable Care Act eine einfache Website zu entwerfen.

Ob ich mit 18 hätte verstehen sollen, dass die Regierungsarbeit den ihr vorangehenden politischen Kampagnen widersprechen könnte.
2948	Certainly, the Abgeordneten Assembly does not follow a preceding course, while an opposition party and recent events like the Newtown Massacre are subject to public debate.	The orderly momentum is not likely to be durable in the coming days, since an opposition party and events like the Newtown massacres hardly predisposes to public debate.	Obviously, the assembly issue is not one to anticipate future developments; a polling party and political events like the Newtown Massacre should form the public debate.	Offensichtlich ist das Abgeordnetenamt kein vorhersehbarer Kurs, da eine Oppositionspartei und zufällige Ereignisse wie das Newtown-Massaker die öffentliche Diskussion prägen.
2949	But if I look at the above-mentioned examples, they seem to be much more likely to be elected by the government themselves.	However, when I look at these above mentioned examples, they seem to be representative of the government at hand.	But when I look at the above mentioned examples, they seem fairly independent of the government themselves.	Doch wenn ich mir die oben genannten Beispiele ansehe, dann scheinen sie weitgehend von der Regierung selbst gewählt zu sein.

2952	Mitt Romney made a confusing and un-straight alternative; he didn't seem to be quite sure of his direction and position.	Mitt Romney faced a confusing and unintended alternative, so that he could not ascertain his direction and position.	Mitt Romney proposed an irrefutable alternative, so that he did not see his direction and positions defined.
