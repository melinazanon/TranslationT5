He noticed, as well, in dogs that the left brain section of the movement is closely controlled and the two hippopotamus play different roles when it comes to feelings.	Furthermore, he noticed that in dogs, exactly as in humans the right brain half part of their movement is repeated and both hippopotamus play different roles in emotions.

985	We will probably be able to tell why this swing can sometimes move in one direction, and in the other direction.	I'm sure we'll get used to putting up with the fact that one might sometimes turn in the other direction.	We may well begin to understand why the swing of a stick in one direction and the other tends to make us aware.	Wahrscheinlich werden wir bald verstehen, warum sich der Schwanz mal in die eine, mal in die andere Richtung bewegt
986	"Professor Valloretto said: ""We've shown the dogs' films with dogs either as a traditional version or a silhouette, to remove distracting aspects and control their movements more towards left or right."""	"Professor Valloretto said: ""We've shown the dogs' movies with dogs either a natural version or a silhouette, to remove distracting aspects, and we were able better control the movement of the wings forwards or down."""

987	When the animals looked like an ordinary dog, the movement to right was totally relaxed by the look of the wedlock.	When the animals saw how a normally unseen dog the zig zag to right (from the perspective of the wedder dog's perspective), they remained completely relaxed.	When the animals saw that a normally disgruntled dog moved towards the left (from the perspective of the wedlock dogs) they remained completely relaxed.	Wenn die Tiere sahen, wie ein ansonsten ausdrucksloser Hund den Schwanz nach rechts bewegt hat (von der Perspektive des wedelnden Hundes aus gesehen), blieben sie völlig entspannt.
988	But the tendency to bite left and, though viewed from the perspective of the dog who got wet, widened her heartbreak and they looked uncomfortable.	Although the tendency to bite was evident from the distance of the dog it were, however, her heart grew and they were infuriated.	However, the tendency to linger down (in other words, the dog who was barking) accentuated her heart rate and they looked unnoticeable.	War aber die Schwanzneigung vornehmlich nach links (wieder aus Perspektive des Hundes, der wedelt), so stieg ihre Herzfrequenz und sie sahen unruhig aus.
989	According to Professor Vallortiara, dogs don't associate with each other in the way that they do.	According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not communicate with one another via this move.

Nach Ansicht von Professor Vallortigara kommunizieren die Hunde nicht absichtlich miteinander durch diese Bewegungen.
990	He is a lot more convinced that the dog had learned through experience how to regulate what movements they should and shouldn't do.	He's a lot more convinced that the dogs learned from experience how to decide when and where they should spend their time worrying.	He is much more convinced that the dogs had learned how to choose which movements they should take and when they do not.

991	When you combine different behaviours with other dogs and dog's waging in a direction which is conducive to friendly behaviour and the right side behaves less politely, then you react on the basis of those experiences.	While a dog's behavior is tended to be more friendly when it encounters another dog or when the owner behaves in a way that is more courteous, and the right side, where it is less friendly, respond accordingly.	"He said, ""If various relationships with other dogs are established and the behaviour of those who stray in a favour of others or that of those on the right side is rewarded with a more friendly behaviour, then this behavior can be decided on the basis of those experiences."""	"Er sagte: „Wenn man verschiedene Begegnungen mit anderen Hunden hat und das Wedeln mit dem Schwanz in eine Richtung eher mit freundlichem Verhalten verknüpft ist und die rechte Seite eher ein weniger freundliches Verhalten produziert, dann reagiert man auf Basis dieser Erfahrungen."""
992	The researchers say that the findings gained by pet parents, breeders and trainers could help them better understand animal emotions.

John Bradshaw, specialist in dog behaviour and guest teaching at the Faculty of Animal health and behavioural science at the University of Bristol explained that it wasn't the first study which was to be done whether there was a link or an rechts correlation between dogs and is important.	John Bradshaw, Experte für Hundeverhalten und Gaststipendiat an der Fakultät für Tierheilkunde der Universität von Bristol erklärte, dies sei nicht die erste Studie gewesen, bei der untersucht wurde, ob links und rechts für Hunde wichtig sei.
994	The University of Lincoln found last year that dogs with their tails bent when they look at an aggressive dog and forward when they are looking at a satisfied canine.

995	"As a colleague at the university of Victoria in Canada, it was said: ""Many people are going on robots when their links become violent and don't turn properly, very much unlike in Italian studies."""	"In one another research study at the University of Victoria in Canada, the author said: ""Many people get on robots when their links are weak and not straight; it's very different from the italian study – much less serious than that of Italian studies."	"In a further research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following is said: ""Many people go robotic even when their ""shorts' links are angled and not straight, making them more dangerous exactly than in the Italian field."""	"In einer anderen Forschungsarbeit an der Universität von Victoria in Kanada stand Folgendes: „Hunde gehen eher auf einen Roboterhund zu, wenn sein ,Schwanz‘ links wedelt und nicht rechts, statt unruhig zu werden – genau andersherum als in der italienischen Studie."""
996	According to his assertion, the difference between the different studies the animals in the films and robots isn't as interesting as the dogs.	According to his statement, the difference could be interpreted by the different studies where the animals in the film are not interrogated or the robot is trained as a dog.	According to his assertion, the difference between the animals in the different studies and robots is not a factor.	Laut seiner Aussage könnten die Unterschiede daher rühren, dass die Hunde in den verschiedenen Studien die Tiere in den Filmen bzw. die Roboterhunde nicht als Hunde interpretierten.

998	The fact that the two brains are linked to different purposes makes perfect sense for many different mammals, but there is a great deal of detail to be considered – dogs are no exception.	"While there are many varied types of mammals that require careful manipulations of both the brain and the brain parts for various purposes, a great deal more detail must be done, so Bradshaw says. ""The fact that dogs don't make an exception of this is because dogs don't make any animals."""	"Although there are some concerns with many different mammals that both the brain halves should be used for various purposes, but most details need to get done – and dogs are not the exception"", says Bradshaw."	"„Zwar gibt es beträchtliche Belege für viele verschiedene Säugetiere, dass die beiden Gehirnhälften für verschiedene Zwecke verwendet werden, doch müssen viele der Details noch bestimmt werden – und Hunde bilden da keine Ausnahme"", so Bradshaw."
999	Since their behavior is simple, its unlikely that we will be able to keep the conversation going beyond that one or the other.	Since their behavior is so simple, it won't take long before we understand why the argument sometimes goes in one direction or other.	The way your behavior is not clear will likely take much time to understand why the swing sometimes in one direction or another might move in the opposite.	Da sich ihr Verhalten aber einfach aufzeichnen lasse, werde es vermutlich nicht lange dauern, bis wir verstehen, weshalb sich der Schwanz manchmal in die eine, manchmal in die andere Richtung bewegt.

1002	Since taking his resignation in June 2008 after a year ten as head of state, Blair has gone far in opposing British foreign policy and restricted his comments on the subject matter of international politics and its role in the Quartet for International Peace.	Since he returned in June 2007 after a decade of rule, Blair has been largely engaged in foreign policy, and most commentary on the issue of foreign policy and his role as an international peacemaker limits him to the Near East.	Having resigned in June 2007, after a year as an ministerial officer, Blair has decided that he was very concerned with the politics of Britain, and his comments most closely focus on the exterior issue and his role in the North East peacekeeping group.

1122	The main reason isn't a snag, but rather the concern of not being allowed to climb stairs to the home and into the flat as an adjunct, explained her.	It's not a cause for concern, but the worry about being allowed to climb stairs to the house and down into the flat can't be explained more simply.	However, the reason isn't to be jealous; it is because of the tendency to move upstairs and into the flat which they explain themselves not being able to do more with less than necessary.	Der Grund ist allerdings keine Spinnenphobie, sondern die Sorge, im Alter die vielen Treppenstufen zum Haus und in der Wohnung nicht mehr bewältigen zu können, erklärt sie.

1136	Every time he gets to the ATC of Tuscany or any other country, he must always remember that he can get sick, too.

1137	"And ""Although you have a good understanding of the language, you can also mix with others in the Dole Vita"" - the technical and literary terms to be considered in the textbooks for Australian kids are largely absent, and the Fachbuchautorin's tendency is to think about it."	Moreover, without knowing the proper language, even in Dolce Vita one can't forget the specialised manual for Australians.	The other thing I can think of is that a good knowledge of the language can't be mixed up in Dolce Vita, and the specialised textbooks on Australian auto-driving are often used to draw conclusions about foreign languages.	Und: 'Ohne gute Kenntnisse der Landessprache vereinsame man auch im Dolce Vita,' gibt die Fachbuchautorin Aussiedlungswilligen zu bedenken.

Not at all like a student group with a common bath and kitchen together.	Schon gar nicht wie in einer Studenten-WG mit einem gemeinsamen Bad und einer Küche.
1142	It just takes a while before people can even have their back to it; that's how I do things.	You just need your recliners when you get old, so on.	You can just use your bedroom to yourself, as they say.	'Im Alter braucht man einfach auch seine Rückzugsräume', so Ries.
1143	As a senior citizen union cannot be formed, the book publisher can't continue to function.	If a Senior Working group can't still operate, there is no way that the bookkeeper could.	If a senior citizen association can't work, the book author cannot.	Dass eine Senioren-Wohngemeinschaft dennoch funktionieren kann, will die Buchautorin dennoch nicht ausschließen.
1144	That would need to take something else than the usual course of student work.	It may well not work as the traditional student group would.	That's different from what happens in the classic student group.	Das müsse dann aber anders verlaufen als in der klassischen Studenten-WG.

1149	That's why elderly people, especially those who have difficulty keeping their normal environment, would often feel uneasy and restricted. This is also the experience of the foundation's research project.	For this reason, elderly people often have difficulties and restrictions in buying just to be able to stay in their usual environment; that's the experience of the foundation’s trade survey, too.	Why many elderly people, especially those who want to be independent, are more likely to choose difficulty in buying than in their usual environment, which is the experience of the foundation's research and analysis.	Deshalb würden gerade ältere Menschen häufig auch Unbequemlichkeiten und Einschränkungen in Kauf nehmen, nur um in ihrer gewohnten Umgebung bleiben zu können, das ist auch die Erfahrung der Stiftung Warentest.

All those who deal with the renovation of their home or apartment should consult only one person before getting involved in it and not ask the best tradesmen to do such a thing.

1153	Even in a flat apartment you make yourself real, and only when the toilet is shut, you clarify the interior architecture.	Whether you rent a place, it helps yourself to realise something. If only the washbasin washes out, the interior architects will clarify.	Even in the rent-home apartment, which has one or other uses for it, only the toilet door handles are drawn out.	Selbst in der Mietwohnung lasse sich das eine oder andere realisieren, und wenn es nur die Toilettensitzerhöhung ist, klärt die Innenarchitektin auf.
1154	It's not always easy to change the existing flat into something new and therefore barrier-free, even when it is still so beautiful.	However, the flat itself is not always fair and in many cases barrier-free, even though it's still so beautiful.	But the existing flat isn't always decorated in a way that makes it barrier free, even when so beautiful.	Aber nicht immer lässt sich die bestehende Wohnung altersgerecht und damit barrierefrei umgestalten, auch wenn sie noch so schön liegt.

1156	Whilst it might have rained in the flat, the way up to the bedroom door could've been much longer, as well.	If you could have installed a lift within the flat, though the trip up to the apartment door would be much longer.	Whilst it could be installed inside the flat a lift can be laid, the same sloped way up to the apartment door would make much greater, but this would probably be far more expensive.	Zwar könnte man innerhalb der Wohnung einen Treppenlift installieren, der ebenfalls mit Treppen gepflasterte Weg bis an die Wohnungstür wäre aber das weitaus größere Hindernis.
1157	She is continuing to look for the perfect object for herself and their husband.	She continues to look for the perfect object for herself and her husband.	She's going to search until she finds the perfect object for herself and her husband.	Sie wird weitersuchen, bis sie das ideale Objekt für sich und ihren Mann gefunden hat.
1158	She grumbles more before she sets her move than before her urchins.	She grates a lot before she goes to her flat door.	It's grumbling before the move as well as after she leaves her flat.	Vor dem Umzug graut es ihr mehr als vor der Spinne an ihrer Wohnungstür.

1202	The lawyer returned home to his doctor, and tens of conversations between the two men were exchanged.

He went back home, picked up his doctor and then had a new set of documents exchanged between them.	Der Anwalt kehrte nach Hause zurück, holte sich die Drogen und dann wurden neun Mitteilungen zwischen den beiden ausgetauscht.
1203	"Before the court was known that Ditta was a ""regulated consumer"" of kain after being sprayed by the hair on his wallet and on his credit cards."	"Against his counsel, it was known that Dipta was a ""normal consumer"" of coke after tests had detected the tip of his wallet and the cheque-reel."	"It was reported beforehand that defendant David was a ""regulatory consumer"" of cocaine, having been found by way of tests both in his hair and in his wallet and credit card."	"Vor Gericht wurde bekannt, dass Ditta ein „regelmäßiger Konsument"" von Kokain war, nachdem bei Tests Drogen der Klasse A in seinen Haaren, seiner Brieftasche und auf seinen Kreditkarten entdeckt worden waren."
1204	Ditta later admitted taking Kokain, saying he'd spoken to the dealer about this and that she claimed to be secretive.	After a while, Dittan was arrested, but refused to take Coka In, saying he spoke to the dealer who he had no authority and that claims their discussions are private.	Ditta later got arrested and refused to take Kokain; he said that he spoke with the dealer because that was his mandate, and claimed that their discussion was secret.	"Ditta wurde später verhaftet, stritt aber ab, Kokain zu nehmen und sagte, er habe mit dem mutmaßlichen Dealer gesprochen, weil dieser sein Mandant sei, und behauptete, ihre Diskussion unterliege dem „Anwaltsgeheimnis""."
1205	During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to get rid of a number of credit cards but these were secured and he was arrested with a hairband.	During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured, and he was entombed with a hairdresser's provocation.	During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and he was sacked.	Während seiner Verhaftung nahm Ditta seine Brieftasche und versuchte, eine Reihe von Kreditkarten zu entfernen, doch sie wurden sichergestellt und ihm wurde eine Haarprobe entnommen.
1206	For the time being on duty he was advised to either call his private address as well as his work place and, for the reasons mentioned above, he would be called at home if necessary.	In cases of law enforcement intervention he was advised that if he were to set foot inside his personal address, or at the office, and warrants would call him from home, as well.	He was told by law that he would be both in his personal address, as well as at work, so that he and their representatives might telephone him home for legal matters.	Beim polizeilichen Verhör gab er an, er betreibe sowohl unter seiner Privatadresse als auch am Arbeitsplatz ein Büro und Mandanten würden ihn zu Hause wegen juristischer Angelegenheiten anrufen.
1207	During his trial, it was well-known that he had represented several defendants after causing deliberations and informed the defendants about what they knew.	Previously, it was known that he had represented several prominent dissenters in a court of law, after which he was accused and informed the prosecutor about her knowledge.	In this case, it was known that he had been involved in the drug trade, representing what the perpetrator of the offense had told him after being executed and informed about what the perpetrator knew about them.

1208	Mary Whyte said: A criminal lawyer, as opposed to anybody else, should know that the law is not breaking.	"Staten Attorney Anne Whyte said: ""You had better let a prosecutor know that the law doesn't break, than all others."""	"In this context, Anne Whyte said: ""A prosecutor should know better than everybody else that the law is not broken than it is broken."""	"Staatsanwältin Anne Whyte sagte: „Ein Strafrechtsanwalt sollte besser als alle anderen wissen, dass man das Gesetz nicht bricht."""
1209	Ditta's postponement is a major complaint because he has been too busy serving in jail on various warrants.	The alleged misconduct of Ditta by his position as a criminal prosecutor stemmed from his inability to cooperate with certain orders.	Ditta was accused of causing a crime because he refused to comply with strict orders.	Ditta wird des Missbrauchs seiner Position als Strafverteidiger angeklagt, da er sich zu sehr mit bestimmten Mandanten eingelassen hat.
1210	The fragile relationship is not just between a doctor, but a doctor who deals with him.	The fragile relationship is not simply a drug dealer's relationship, but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.	This delicate relationship is not just the drug dealer, but a drug dealer who deals drugs with his lawyer.	Die fragliche Beziehung ist nicht einfach die eines Drogenhändlers, sondern eines Drogenhändlers, der seinen Anwalt mit Drogen versorgt.
1211	Part of his statements were legitimate; he was the lawyer who handled it.	There was a part of his correspondence that he wasn't authorized to, as he was the lawyer representing that person.	A part of his communications was legitimate, since he was the lawyer whom this person dealt with.	Ein Teil seiner Mitteilungen war zweifellos legitim, denn er war der Anwalt dieser Personen.
1212	However, this crossed the line between lawyer and client.	But this far overtook what was normally the case between lawyer and attorney.	That however went a great deal beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between counsel and client.	Doch das ging weit über die Grenzen einer normalen Beziehung zwischen Anwalt und Mandant hinaus.
1213	He tried the policing measures best possible so that she could continue his criminal activities.	He countered the police investigations as far as he could so she could continue their criminal activities.	He countered the police erroneously so as to continue their criminal activities.	Er wirkte den polizeilichen Ermittlungen soweit wie möglich entgegen, sodass sie weiterhin ihren kriminellen Aktivitäten nachgehen konnten.
1214	Mr. Ditta made up his mind to his career.	Mr. Ditto brought down his job, causing the loss of his professional capacity.	Mr Ditta put his work-at-risk.	Herr Ditta brachte damit seinen Berufsstand in Verruf.
1215	He refused certain mandates in particular Scarborough, and he made it clear that his independence was achieved.	He had come close to completing certain assignments, particularly in Scarborough, and he managed it out so as to make his independence possible.	He arose too close to certain orders, particularly in Scarborough, and he made it possible to resolve his independence.	Er stand bestimmten Mandanten zu nahe, insbesondere Scarborough, und er ließ es zu, dass seine Unabhängigkeit kompromittiert wurde.
1216	Doing all her misfortunes and presuming to be an arbiter, as if I were not, and if you want information about the town of Scarborough, I wouldn't wait for fifteen hours, but it would do immediately.	If I were a criminal lawyer, which I would not be, and if I could not give further information about Scarborough, I wouldn't wait for fifteen hours, but instead do it at once.	If I were a solicitor who wouldn't be involved in providing information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, but immediately.	"Ditta wies jedes Fehlverhalten von sich und behauptete: „Wenn ich ein korrupter Anwalt wäre, was ich nicht bin, und Informationen an Scarborough weitergeben wollte, dann würde ich keine 15 Stunden warten, sondern das sofort tun."""
1217	"Nonetheless, after hearing Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said that Mr. Ditta has taken the step of an offender into a criminal investigation at the moment he began to acquire the tools to obtain the drugs from organized crime."""	"But following the hearing, Inspector Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: ""Roy Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defence officer to a crime organisation when he started to acquire the drug from organised crime syndicates."""	"However, after listening to Inspector Matthew Halstead from the police in Lancashire said: ""Her Ditta went on to become a criminal prosecutor at the moment he began to procurate drugs from organised criminals."""	"Doch nach der Anhörung sagte Superintendent Lee Halstead von der Polizei in Lancashire: „Herr Ditta hat den Schritt von einem Strafverteidiger zu einem Kriminellen in dem Moment getan, als er anfing, Drogen von organisierten Kriminellen zu erwerben."""
1218	His codependence led to a hoarding and leniency approach, making him imprecise in the motivations of members of the organized crime team who hired him to obtain valuable information on policy issues.	His corruption led to a holocaustless complicity which made him actively suspecting the motives that motivated members of organized crime who commissioned him to collect valuable information on police investigations.	His corruption led to a hoarding of promises that, while not being respected for the motives of the organized criminal order who arrested him, he was embezzled with the intent to obtain valuable information about police investigations.	Seine Kokainabhängigkeit führte zu einer hoffnungslosen Kompromittierung und machte ihn empfänglich für die Motive führender Mitglieder der organisierten Kriminalität, die ihn beauftragten, wertvolle Informationen über polizeiliche Ermittlungen einzuholen.
1219	Lawyers have to uphold the highest standards of integrity and in the public for trust and respect.	Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity in the public and ensure trust and vigilance.	Lawyers must take the highest standards of integrity and trust in the public.	Anwälte müssen die höchsten Standards an Integrität aufrechterhalten und in der Öffentlichkeit für Vertrauen und Zuversicht sorgen.
1220	Dotta has left this faith behind, planning to set herself down behind the facade of his career.	Daphne lost her trust and is trying to hide behind the facade of his career.	Titta has a backlash that she's trying to hide behind the facade of his job.	Ditta hat dieses Vertrauen hintergangen und versucht, sich hinter der Fassade seines Berufs zu verschanzen.
1221	The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in London led the investigation on behalf of individuals who were prosecuted with coke and justification, which is why our decision to bring criminal charges was withdrawn.	The Unit for the prevention and abolition of organised crime led to the executions of six people for possession, possession and possession of cocaine. In this case, our decision made it necessary to bring matters before the court was not enough in favour of our decision.	The Unit for the Prevention and Control of Crimes of Lancashire, led the charge against Tatta – in three cases our decision to bring criminal charges led to a conviction for possession of cocaine and justification.	Die Serious and Organised Crime Unit von Lancashire leitete die Ermittlungen gegen Ditta, die auch zu einer Verurteilung in drei Fällen wegen des Besitzes von Kokain und Justizbehinderung führten, was unsere Entschlossenheit unterstreicht, Kriminelle vor Gericht zu bringen.
1222	In this case, it should be warned and prove that no one can pull out of court.	In this case, criminals should be warned and demonstrate that they cannot remove the arm of the law.	It should be noted that criminal activity should not be taken lightly and shows that no one can carry out the act.	Dieser Fall sollte Kriminellen eine Warnung sein und zeigt, dass sich keiner dem Arm des Gesetzes entziehen kann.
1223	We'll find you and take you to court.	We've found you and brought you to court.	We'll find you and take you to court.	Wir finden Sie und bringen Sie vor Gericht.
1224	Scarborough was sentenced to four years for his arrest for committing heroin and cokaine sales.	Scarborough was sentenced to fourteen years in prison after he pleaded guilty to the charges of heroin, cocaine and cannabis possession.

1226	A section on his website contains questions and answers about what he admitted he'd been asked to do as a lawyer in the U.S, where his ultimatum guest is Mohammed Ali and his chancental appointment is the motivation for his work.	His website contained a section with questions and answers concerning his dream job as a lawyer in the USA, where his ultimatum guest was Mohammad Ali who at dinnertime was mentioned and that there was no reason for his employment.	In his website he revealed that his dream job was to represent in the United States, and his ultimatum guest was Mohammed Ali after supper and the chances of his work were lost.	Auf seiner Website veröffentlichte Ditta einen Bereich mit Fragen und Antworten über sich, in dem er angab, sein Traumjob sei es, als Anwalt Mandanten in der Todeszelle in Amerika zu vertreten, sein ultimativer Gast beim Abendessen sei Mohammed Ali und Chancenungleichheit sei die Motivation für seine Arbeit.
1227	The police are permitted to reopen at the last minute.	The police are not expected to rush back until the last moment.	Until the jetties, the police can focus on a quiet Halloween night.	Bis zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt kann die Polizeiinspektion Kempten auf eine ruhige Halloween-Nacht zurückblicken.
1228	The officials were only called to address children who were being abused against their own property.	The staff were only called twice to ask for children, which they would use to spread the word about.	The personnel were not allowed to call children for education, as these were swum about the house.	Die Beamten wurden lediglich zweimal zu eierwerfenden Kindern gerufen, welche diese gegen Hausfassaden warfen.
1229	Because the homeowners who found fault on time, and the inheritors immediately removed, there will not be any harm in doing so.	The fact that the homeowners recognized it early and the relatives just removed does not mean that it caused a problem.	Because the housekeepers were early to recognise and the relatives were soon removed, nothing should be done about it, either.	Da die Hauseigentümer dies rechtzeitig erkannten und die Eierreste gleich entfernten, dürfte auch kein Sachschaden entstanden sein.
1230	Although many people in the town's hamlet were rescued, there was not an injury caused by that, but also this wasn't an accident.	Many cyclists have been killed in the town area, but there was not a lot of damage done there.	Certainly some sylvesterböller were involved in the town's development, but also not at any cost.	Desweiteren wurden im Stadtgebiet wohl auch einige Sylvesterböller gezündet, aber auch hier ist kein Sachschaden entstanden.
1231	A resident in a village of Farsi reported getting his motorcycle covered with cardboard and throwing its tires away.	A living in Bischof-French alleged that his motorcycle had been covered with cardboard and his bicycle was turned upside down.	An accompanist in Bishofrey said he has covered his pc with plastic and tyres are turned around.	Ein Anwohner im Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg meldete, dass sein Pkw mit Klopapier eingewickelt und seine Radzierblenden entwendet wurden.
1232	He found all of his cyclists before they met the police, so he didn't have to intervene further.	The police found a man carrying his bicycles in close proximity, but the police couldn't work it out because they didn't have to.	Fortunately, the police found all his riot arresters before they could have been committed, so the police didn't have to take anything further than that.	Bis zum Eintreffen der Polizei hat der Mann seine Radzierblenden jedoch in unmittelbarer Nähe alle wieder aufgefunden, weswegen die Polizei nicht weiter tätig werden musste.

1238	You've not only written a lot for us, you've made so many rounds for us that our big thanks go to Mr. Slotman, the president of the choir who led the charge.	You've done not just much for us, but also made so many rounds for ourselves, as the choir president, Erich Schlotmann.	"Your singing has not only been busy for us, but you've arranged so many rounds for us to thank our very kindly. ""The conductor of the choir, Erich Schlotman, said in his opening sentence."	"""Du hast nicht nur viel für uns aufgeschrieben, sondern hast auch so manche Runde für uns gedreht, dafür unser herzliches Dankeschön"", so der Vorsitzende des Chores Erich Schlotmann."
1239	For the year ending March 14th, the participation in the performance and rehearsals was arranged by the conductor Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairperson, and the finalist, Friedrich Winkler, the winner for the first time, taking each participant from 42 to 40 participants.	"The prizes for the participation in the auditions and recitals, as well as those awarded to the President of the Choral Committee Hortie-Ribbert, who was elected Chairman, and the youngest judge, Friedrich Winkler, the ""Songwriter's Day"" went down with four."	"The awards for the participation in the auditions and rehearsals, by way of rescheduling, were awarded to Mr. Ribbert, who was also chairperson, and last year, ""Singer of the Year"" Friedrich Winkler, with respective 42 participants."	"Die Auszeichnungen für die Teilnahme an den Auftritten und Chorproben mittels Aktivitätssträußchen gingen in diesem Jahr an den Chorleiter Dieter Schulze mit 44 Teilnahmen, gefolgt vom Ehrenvorsitzenden Horst Pier-Ribbert, dem Vorsitzenden selbst, und dem letztjährigen ""Sänger des Jahres"" Friedrich Winkler mit jeweils 42 Teilnahmen."
1240	No sooner did an order from Artur Brückner than from the fifth to the fifth-floor.	No one praised lawyer Artur Brückner for placing himself in fifth.	At fifth and five o'clock, the lawyer Artur Brückner ranked first.	Platz fünf belegte Notenwart Artur Brückner.
1241	A special thanks went out to the board of astrologer George Pier-Ribbert, who again created the Men's Extra class and to Gerda Pier-ribber for the table decoration.	A special thank you to the committee for the club's president, Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again created a Men’s Extraklasse and was also paid homage to Gerda Pier-ribber for the table decorations.	A special thanks was extended to the committee for the team of footballer Ange Pier-Ribbert, who again impressed and then to Gerda Pier-Richard for the table setting.	Ein besonders Dankeschön richtete der Vorstand an das Team von Vereinswirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, das einmal mehr ein Menü der Extraklasse gezaubert hatte und an Gerda Pier-Ribbert für die Tischdekoration.
1242	"The MGV's ""Friedrich Wilson"" always reaches the club's offices on Sundays at around 3:30."	"The MGV ""Friedrich Woolf"" always gets his choristers in their clubhouse before 11:30."	"The ""Macaulay Wheel"" always gets his choral rehearsals at 1:30 am in the club hall."	"Der MGV ""Friedrich-Wilhelm"" trifft sich zu seinen regelmäßigen Chorproben immer dienstags um 19.45 Uhr im Vereinslokal."
1243	"""New voices are welcome wherever we go"", said Schlotman."	No matter how vocal, new voices are welcome — and so Schlotman said.	We're always welcome to new voices, says Schlotman.	"""Neue sangesfreudige Stimmen sind uns jederzeit herzlich willkommen"", so Schlotmann."
1244	The Council is taking washing-room equipment to the local market.	Rats are moving water plants into the Arctic.	Rats are turning green buildings into plants.	Rat nimmt Gleisanlagen ins Visier
1245	"Should the train crossing ""Amsh"" be made up to ensure that it is safe?"	"Do you want to have the tram stop ""On the slopes"" extended so as to increase the safety of the traffic?"	"Do you intend to make the tram ""At the stogies"" permanent so as to enhance the safety of the traffic?"	"Soll der Bahnübergang ""Am Hirschen"" aufwändig umgebaut werden, um die Verkehrssicherheit zu erhöhen?"
1246	Yes, the town council has called.	Yes, they've approved the town council.	Certainly, the council's decision was unanimous.	Ja, haben die Gemeinderäte beschlossen.
1247	You have to take a maximum of 225 000 euro.	For this reason, they must take 20 000 euros.	You have to put a further twenty 000 euros in your pocket.	Schiltach muss dafür 220 000 Euro in die Hand nehmen.
1248	The Deutsche Railway is planning to improve the Kinztal rail line in the coming year.	The German railways are going to upgrade their Kinztal Railway station next year.	The Deutsche Railway is going to improve the network of the Kinzai line in the coming year.	Die Deutsche Bahn will im kommenden Jahr die Kinzigtal-Bahnstrecke verbessern.
1249	In particular, the safety of rail tracks should be increased - it is common to run into collisions between vehicles.	There's been much to be increased in rail traffic safety: it regularly happens that trains collide with other vehicles.	One particularly important thing is to make sure there are adequate measures for crossings. It is common to have collisions with other vehicles across the country.	Besonders soll dabei die Sicherheit an Bahnübergängen erhöht werden - regelmäßig kommt es bundesweit zu Kollisionen von Zügen mit anderen Fahrzeuge.
1250	When it comes to the extension of the building works, they've got to agree on the cost – half the work and the rest is rail and cable.	Should the councils approve the measures to be carried out, they must contribute one third of the cost, with the rest running on foot and by rail.	If the council wants to undertake renovations, they have to contribute a third of the cost; while the rest go by rail and local bus.	Stimmen die Gemeinden den Umbaumaßnahmen zu, müssen sie sich mit einem Drittel an den Kosten beteiligen, den Rest teilen sich Bahn und Bund.
1251	"City architect Roland Grießhaber explained the town's general plan of how to improve the slope ""to the highest point in the valley""."	"As a result of the squat, the town's architect Roland Grießhaber explained the local council the peculiarities of the area ""with regard to el"" for the village planning authority."	"The swiss city planner Roland Gießhaber explained to the town's council the distinctive features of the ""on site"" area."	"Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber erläuterte dem Gemeinderat die Besonderheiten des Bahübergangs ""Am Hirschen""."
1252	There were plans to build the town at the foot of the tunnel junction west of the railway line.	There're plans to construct the town, on the site of the tunnelmatte west of the railway station, an outstation.	There is where the town constructs, on the west side of that tunnel, a bookshop.	Dort plant die Stadt, in Höhe des dortigen Tunnelmundes westlich der Bahngleise eine Ausbuchtung zu bauen.
1253	They could also accommodate larger vehicles, such as those transporting logs in transit without having to block the tracks.	You could put a bigger vehicle, for example, who has to be hauled in traffic without having to block it.	There were also larger vehicles, such as those that are transporting lumber when it isn't necessary to block the tracks.	Dort könnten auch größere Fahrzeuge, zum Beispiel solche, die Langholz transportieren, bei Gegenverkehr stehen, ohne die Gleise blockieren zu müssen.
1254	Those who work in pavements should think of using the pavement's curbmark so as to allow the town to widen the street to accommodate a dangerous traffic flow to ensure it isn't blocked out.	Grumbling enthusiasts are joking around the idea of creating an appropriate buffer so as to make city and town's pavements wide enough to allow for maintenance work to be done on time in order to avoid jam-packed traffic.	Consequently, pavement maintenance men and their crew should consider implementing a necessary strut so as to allow the street to be wide enough to accommodate a dangerous traffic flow.	Grießhaber schlug daher vor, eine erforderliche Stützmauer so zu konstruieren, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße zu gegebener Zeit verbreitern könne, um einen reibungslosen Verkehrsfluss zu gewährleisten.
1255	"The matter was debated in the community council as some proposals raised the question of whether there was any doubt about a traffic ban: Thomas Kipp raised his objection to the criticismer's idea that ""We need to spend so little money on things like that?"""	"It was debated in the village council over whether there was any doubt about the impact of traffic jams, Thomas Kipp raising his objection on the issue ""How can we carry so much money in our pocket?"	"The subject was debated on the council's grounds, as some rules cast the question of whether a traffic jam was likely to occur: Thomas Kipp urged the critic to raise the point with his invocation: ""Do we have to take that much money in order to make this happen because there is so few cars?"""	"Dies wurde im Gemeinderat kontrovers diskutiert, da einige Räte die Notwendigkeit einer Straßenverbreitung in Zweifel zogen: Thomas Kipp brachte mit seiner Äußerung die Stimmung der Kritiker auf den Punkt: ""Müssen wir wegen so wenigen Fahrzeugen so viel Geld in die Hand nehmen?"""
1256	"Mayor Thomas Haas said that the railway station ""Heaven"" is regularly used to transport tyres."	"Mayor Thomas Haas announced that the railway bridge ""Hirs"" is regularly used for the carriageway transport."	Mayor Thomas Haas said that the rail station entrance is regularly used for transporting log books.	"Bürgermeister Thomas Haas widersprach: Der Bahnübergang ""Hirschen"" werde regelmäßig für Langholztransporte genutzt."
1257	Especially lumber from the area of Kuhbach is transportable some way, because the up to 20 meter long vehicles cannot be used in line at the crossing because they couldn't get to the main road.	"Even wood from the ""Kuhbach"" can be transported on this stretch because the vehicles up to 20 m long could not use it due to their location in that part of town. They could not reach the junction, going down to the traffic circle because they couldn't get round there."	"Likewise, the section of ""Cokebach"" is being transported along this route because the vehicles as far to 20 m can't be used because they cannot get to the main roadside."	"Selbst Holz aus dem Bereich ""Kuhbach"" werde teilweise über diese Strecke transportiert, weil die bis zu 20 Meter langen Fahrzeuge die Strecke an der Häberlesbrücke nicht nutzen könnten, weil sie dort nicht in die Hauptstraße abbiegen könnten."
1258	Across the line is the line as a route for any vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when it's blocked by the main street, argumented Haase.	The length of the stretch is interpreted as a line to the vehicles that cannot be used in traffic jams when the route leads into the town centre, argumentation continued.	Further out, the section of the route is considered to be a link for those vehicles which are not permitted use of the tunnel when it is blocked off the highway, arguments were made.	Darüber hinaus diene die Strecke als Umleitungfür diejenigen Fahrzeuge, die den Tunnel nicht benutzen dürfen, wenn die Hauptstraße gesperrt ist, argumentierte Haas.
1259	"Because it is improbable that Kirchberg and Schlossberg should be built and sanitised as they are in Wolfsburg, the railway crossing ""Arctic"" could also be used for an extended period to allow traffic congestion to remain."	"A major traffic event being stubbed and reconstructed (as it is now in Wolfchasl), the railway station crossing ""Only on a short-term basis"", but that is not expected to be taken into consideration."	"As a consequence of the fact that Kirchberg and Castelberg were to be constructed and maintained, in the case of Wolfsburg, it is not possible to extend the crossing ""Only On"" for a longer period of time, as well."	"Da abzusehen sei, dass Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnel umgebaut und saniert werden müssten, wie dies derzeit in Wolfach der Fall ist, könne dem Bahnübergang ""Am ""Hirschen"" auch für einen längeren Zeitraum eine wichtige Verkehrsbedeutung zukommen."
1260	The rats got inside to ask how much the planned widening of the street would cost.	The rumor spread, suggesting how much the planned widening of the street might cost.	The plot went round to finding out how much the planned widening of the street would cost.	Die Räte kamen überein, untersuchen zu lassen, welche Kosten die angedachte Verbreiterung der Straße verursachen würde.
1261	"Not stumbling over the rail crossing is considered more important in ensuring the required bridge is constructed so that the route to ""Station Street"" can be reached by about five meters, being allowed to extend as far as the road to the junction."	"In addition to the building of the crossing, the measure of the height needed to be widened up is enough to make the street from ""stationary"" around 5,5 metres for the purpose of crossing."	"Considering that construction of the crossing was made more extensive by the requirement for the necessary scaffold to be constructed so as to accommodate the city's further extension to the ""Trainway Road"", as it were planned, to reach about five mq."	"Ungeachtet dessen wurde dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs mehrheitlich zugestimmt mit der Maßgabe, dass die erforderliche Stützmauer so gebaut wird, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße Richtung ""Bahnhofstraße"" gegebenenfalls für Begegnungsverkehr auf rund 5,5 Meter ausbauen könne."
1262	"The tram bridge over the town centre could be a completely different problem to those travelling along the steep ""Gerolthaus Way"" which is a steep climb."	"The paving of the track crossing to the Gerberei Trautwin may have caused quite another problem, as it is in regard to the steep ""Royal Street"" heading up."	"The construction of the cross bridge at the Gerberei Trautwitz could pose a whole other problem, in which the path ""Gerolthaus"" is steeply inclined."	"Der Umbau des Bahnübergangs bei der Gerberei Trautwein könnte dagegen ein ganz anderes Problem nach sich ziehen, das die Zufahrt in den stark ansteigenden ""Geroltzhäuser Weg"" betrifft."
1263	The transport team had been considering the layout of the track from the engineering office in question, doubting whether the planned connection to the town's historic landmark would remain possible.	The management rejected the plans for the railway extension by the engineer's bureau of Breinlinger, as they doubted if the planned connection with the town hall route should be repeated without further planning.	The management had ordered the building plans for the railway from the engineer's office Breinlinger, doubting whether the planned link to the town hall was possible then without further planning.	Die Verwaltung hatte die Umbaupläne der Bahn vom Ingenieurbüro Breinlinger untersuchen lassen, da sie Zweifel daran hatte, ob der geplante Anschluss des Geroltzhäuser Wegs dann noch ohne weiteres möglich sei.
1264	A final result came to a conclusion that the investigation couldn't agree with the traffic conditions that would lead to long delays.	The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not feasible for the traffic conditions to allow for longer vehicles on the road.	The investigation came to an end, which did not exclude the effect that traffic conditions could cause longer cars to sit.	Die Untersuchung kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass nicht auszuschließen sei, dass die Neigungsverhältnisse der Straße dazu führen könnten, dass längere Fahrzeuge aufsitzen.
1265	The responsibility herein lies again in the city as a pavement repairer.	This responsibility falls to the town as a pavement repairman.	The responsibility for this happens to the city as the bridgeslayer.	Die Verantwortung hierfür trage wiederum die Stadt als Straßenbaulastträgerin.
1266	The construction can then arise withstanding liability disputes.	The build is liable to the following: it may cause a claim for damages.	The build may result in litigation.	Der Umbau könne demnach Haftungsstreitigkeiten nach sich ziehen.
1267	As both the beams and the beams are broken, it should not be a good idea to change the track bridge, argued Haas.	Because both the beamway and the apron not working correctly, the construction of the platform shouldn't be allowed.	Since both the beams and the abbottles are in the current state of repair, the construction of the crossing road is not supposed to be allowed.	Da sowohl die Holzabfuhr als auch das Abbiegen im aktuellen Ausbauzustand funktionierten, solle man dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs nicht zustimmen, argumentierte Haas.
1268	Even though a collision with another vehicle on the way here is significantly lower, even where it is just adjacent to the central stop point. It's best to make a good line-up.	Also, the risk of collisions between two vehicles on the way here is considerably lower than in other stations because they are just nearing the stop point midway, which is best for a good view.	Even though there are fewer accidents on the crossing than in other stations, where just beyond the junctions is to make good connections.	Auch sei an dieser Stelle das Risiko einer Kollision des Zuges mit einem auf dem Übergang stehenden Fahrzeug deutlich geringer als an den anderen Bahnübergängen, weil sich direkt daneben der Haltepunkt Mitte befinde, zu dem eine gute Sichtverbindung bestehe.
1269	Even a short walk from the main station to this spot should have been sufficiently abbreviated so that no bump is caused.	Even if you went up from the main block, you must have already done enough to make sure that there isn't any serious collision.	Even a short walk from the mainbahnhof has to be so far as not to cause a collision.	Selbst Züge vom Hauptbahnhof her müssten an dieser Stelle schon soweit abgebremst sein, dass keine Kollision drohe.
1270	"To make this track crossing the majority of the city's decision was defeated, the city must ""fix the problem with the parking lot"", thus causing the delay as well as the relocation of the station to its responsibility once it has finished working."	During this train crossing, the majority of the crowd was abhorring the approval, as the city imposed the problem with vehicles on board, as the railway station could not afford to take the decision, moving the train after it had finished work.	The majority of the vote in this section voted against the amendment, because the town must take up the problem with overtaking vehicles and, as a result, the referendum was set aside so that the rail station could be pulled out after the construction work's been finished.	"Mehrheitlich wurde dem Umbau dieses Bahnübergangs die Zustimmung verweigert, da die Stadt Schiltach das Problem mit aufsitzenden Fahrzeugen ""ausbaden müsste"", so die Räte, da sich die Bahn nach Abschluss der Bauarbeiten aus der Verantwortung zurückziehen könne."
1271	"If it was not difficult to see the junctions ""Voor Heubach"" and ""Voor Kuhbach"", the construction works already carried out by the rail network have been compared with those already crossing."	"The construction of the tracks ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Kuhbach"" was hardly an issue to consider, as already crossings were made."	"The general look on the tracks, ""Voor Heubach"" and ""Von Kuhbach"", for which crossings have already been carried out, is unavoidable."	"Als unproblematisch betrachtet das Gremium die Umbauten an den Bahnübergängen ""Vor Heubach"" und ""Vor Kuhbach"", für die bereits Kreuzungsvereinbarungen mit der Bahn getroffen wurden."

1274	The present event is a mirage: construction works have begun on the south-east pipeline, which is the biggest and most important project in Europe, said the chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in an explanation to the board of directors.	The incident is one of a kind: construction works on the eastern section of the South East Pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, said the president of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in an explanation given to the press conference on Monday.	The latest incident is a disaster: Construction work on the bulgarian section of the South East Gas Pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, announced Alexei Miller, the chairman of Gazprom on Thursday in an explanation.	"„Das heutige Ereignis ist ein Meilenstein: Die Bauarbeiten am bulgarischen Abschnitt der South-Stream-Gaspipeline, dem größten und wichtigsten Projekt in Europa, haben begonnen"", sagte der Vorstandsvorsitzende von Gazprom, Alexei Miller, am Donnerstag in einer Erklärung."

1277	In a trade between Gazprom and his Pendants in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, consider the risk of travel on conventional routes as far from the official site.	Gazprom and its subsidiaries in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, pose an increased risk on conventional routes, as it's official page.	A contract between Gazprom and a partner in Ukraine, where the bulk of the Russian gas for Europe is stored, puts an increased risk on conventional routes, as it is supposed to be heard from the official side.	Ein Vertragsstreit zwischen Gazprom und seinen Pendants in der Ukraine, in dem der Großteil des russischen Gases für Europa gelagert ist, sorge für ein erhöhtes Risiko bei konventionellen Routen, wie von offizieller Seite zu hören ist.
1278	"Miller said the direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, suggested that the ""for always"" geopolitical risks to transit countries were likely to be active."	"Miller said that the direct contact with Bulgaria, a member of Europe, meant that diplomatic relations between the two countries were ""forever"" forbidden."	"Miller said the immediate connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, claimed that the geopolitical sanctions on transit countries were ""for always""."	"Miller sagte, die direkte Verbindung nach Bulgarien, einem Mitglied der Europäischen Union, bedeute, dass die mit Transitländern verknüpften geopolitischen Risiken „für immer"" ausgeschaltet seien."

1287	Taking up the name of Peter Kleemann and Radio Vienna, the airport's appearance in regard to individuals corresponds to an international trend.	Having known that the airport was haunted by Peter Kleemann, according to The Times, airport Wien follows an international trend of travel and personal appearances.	As soon as Peter Kleemann was revealed to Radio Wien, the airport's behaviour towards individuals constitutes an international trend.	Wie Airport-Sprecher Peter Kleemann gegenüber Radio Wien bekannt gab, folgt der Flughafen Wien mit der Einstellung von Durchsagen, die einzelne Personen betreffen, einem internationalen Trend.
1288	By and large, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already avoid the noisy ringing calls that are ringing.	By the way, do not hesitate to call the emergency services in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai.	So, it is already possible to avert the annoying calls made by airports like Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai.	So verzichten bereits unter anderem die Flughäfen in Kopenhagen, Frankfurt oder Dubai auf die lärmenden Aufrufe.
1289	Due to the way this transaction ends, a day's average of about 200 personal calls are sent through the telephone receiver. It is expected that will become calmer at the airport in future.	Considering the way these passages work - in total, they carry out around 200 private calls a day - it is likely to remain quieter at the airport.	By the way that these passages pass - in which, by average, there are around 200 personal phone calls per day through the speakers – this may soon go quieter at the airport.	Durch den Wegfall dieser Durchsagen - im Durchschnitt ertönen an einem Tag rund 200 persönliche Aufrufe durch die Lautsprecher - soll es künftig ruhiger am Flughafen zugehen.
1290	It has proved through experience that this particular phrase was only a couple of times, but every other information to change the flight or departure time has also been changed in the radio conversation, said Kleemann.	The experience proved that these individual adversities were relatively short-hand, but all other information on how to change your travel time or departure dates as discussed in the radio programme, said Kleemann.	The experience has shown that these individual messages are hardly true, and all the other information about changes in time for travel or departure, as Kleemann in a conversation with the radio programme said.	"""Es hat sich auch in der Erfahrung gezeigt, dass diese individuellen Durchsagen relativ wenig wahrgenommen wurden, gleichzeitig aber auch alle anderen Informationen zu geänderten Flugsteigen oder Abflugzeiten hier ein bisschen untergehen"", so Kleemann im Gespräch mit dem Radiosender."

It could be said that New York city is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: a mere centennial ago, director Frank Fay, working as a stage performer in the Palace Theatre on Broadway, worked to convince the assembled audience to talk directly in conversation.	It may well be said that New York City is the capital of stand-up comedy in America: Just a hundred years ago, the composer Frank Fay, working as a speaker in the Palace Theatre on Broadway, worked so that he would direct the conversation.	Man könnte sagen, dass New York City die Geburtsstätte von Stand-up Comedy in Amerika ist: Vor knapp hundert Jahren fing der Varietekünstler Frank Fay, der als Conférencier im Palace Theatre am Broadway arbeitete, damit an, der Menge direkt Witze in Form eines Gesprächs zu erzählen.

1547	It will be very severe, assured Walker.	That will be painful, the spokesman said.	It's going to be cut, said Watzke.	"""Das wird einschneidend"", versicherte Watzke ."

1650	Land Rover Rally Series was canceled.	Land Rover Rally Series is canceled.	Land Rover Rally Series is a rearranged race.	Land Rover Rally Series angekündigt
1651	There's a meeting room and conference hall, as well.	There's a rumor-mill as well, with a free-standing telephone and speaker.	The Interiour has a meeting- and meeting rooms, as well as two conference rooms.	Im Interieur finden sich Rennsitze und Sechs-Punkt-Gurte sowie eine Freisprechanlage.
1652	The options include accelerated contract negotiations, a package of technical support with support from field mechanics and logistical support up to the transport between events.	These options range from intensive training to full service with support of Bowler Workers Mechanics and logistical support through to the carpooling between events.	The options range from enhanced concessions, a package with services provided by Bowler Workers' and logistical support as far to the event's in between.	Die Optionen reichen von verstärkten Bremsen, einem Servicepaket mit Betreuung von Bowler-Works-Mechanikern und logistischer Unterstützung bis hin zu Fahrzeugeinlagerung zwischen Veranstaltungen.

"Drew Bowler, chief executive of Bowling Green Motorsports, explained: ""The road race teams who come to bowling have changed."""	"Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowling Cars, explained that ""the formulas that come to bowling have changed."""

1654	You aren't all experienced race drivers; you are people who are looking for excitement and courage along with an accessible path to world class courses.	They aren't all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and courage, and seeking an accessible path to world class university.	They are not all experienced Rennfahrers, but people searching for excitement and absorption, and seeking out a way to reach world class performances.	Sie sind nicht alle erfahrene Rennfahrer, sondern Leute, die auf der Suche nach Spannung und Abenteuer sind sowie nach einem erreichbaren Weg zu Weltklasse-Veranstaltungen.
1655	We are pleased to be able to partner with Land Rover and the MSA, and we believe there are many options for allowing visitors to experience and prepare for the various racing events in America and abroad, as well as the prospect of race preparation.	We are happy to be in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and believe that the format of creating new possibilities to discover the various circuits in the United States and abroad, as well as the potential for road race preparation, along with the necessity for roadside demonstrations, as well as the practicality of hill climbs, as well as how to prepare for the use of Rally Raids.	We look forward to starting this partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format of new possibilities makes possible the experience of various road events in the United Kingdom and abroad, and the potential for road races as well.	Wir freuen uns, diesen Weg in Partnerschaft mit Land Rover und der MSA eröffnen zu können und glauben, dass das Format neue Möglichkeiten erschließt, die verschiedenen Rally-Disziplinen in Großbritannien und dem Ausland zu erleben und Neulinge auf die Strapazen und die Wirklichkeit von Rally Raid vorzubereiten.
1656	We had a great deal fun working on the Defender Challenge weapon – it will become an under-the-radar weapon!	We really enjoyed forming the Defender Challenge Warrior, which will become an underground battle.	We had a great time developing the Defender Challenge weapon, which would give it an understatement.	Wir hatten wirklich Spaß daran, den Defender Challenge-Wagen zu entwickeln – das wird eine unterhaltsame Meisterschaft.
1657	In addition, there is a training and test day in the Defender's Challenge in February as well as the option to take part in the World Championships in North Africa and the Near East.	A training and test day in February are also offered in the Defender Challenge, as well as the option of taking part in the World Cup races in North Africa and the northern hemisphere.	Further on, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February, as well as the option to take part in the World Cup both in North Africa and the Near East.	Darüber hinaus gibt es bei der Defender Challenge einen Trainings- und Testtag im Februar sowie die Option, an Wüstenrennen in Nordafrika und dem Nahen Osten teilzunehmen.
1658	George Kerevan: The European Parliament gives the sworn parliament the vote.	George Kerevan: In the European Parliament, the federations give the governors the choice of their members.	George Kerevan: European Union gives the bishops the choice.	George Kerevan: Europäische Entflechtung gibt den Schotten die Wahl
1659	A new day, a new story of freedom.	There is a new day, an unfamiliar story towards independence.	A new day, a new history of independence.	Ein neuer Tag, eine neue Schreckensgeschichte zur Unabhängigkeit.
1660	This year, we were warned that having an independent Spain would be necessary to enter the European Union on the basis of the terms and conditions set out above.	We've been warned that it is necessary for Scotland to accept the Treaty of Nice as a condition for entering EU membership.	We're warned that a separate Scotland was necessary to enter the Schengen Treaty as part of the agreement with the EU.	Diesmal werden wir gewarnt, dass ein unabhängiges Schottland erforderlich sei, um dem Schengen-Raum als Bedingung für die EU-Mitgliedschaft beizutreten.
1661	It is a great dictionary for stories about journeys across Britain, as well as a secure border with staphed lines.	This is the most dependable and reliable source of stories about traffic in Berwick, as well as a strong-wired border between Hadrianswall and Hadrians Wall.	This is a good word for stories about crossing paths in Berwick, and a stain-resistant boundary along Hadrian's wall.	Das liefert das Stichwort für Geschichten über Passkontrollen in Berwick und eine mit Stacheldraht gesicherte Grenze entlang des Hadrianswalls.
1662	In fact, the Strathclyde debate was largely concerned with the possible economic avantajs of having more freedom in the restyl Europe, though it was definitely not the case that struck me that.	Tat in the Strathclyde debate on the possible economic benefits of allowing more freedom to travel in the resting European country was not considered, however, it made no difference if that – presumptively — played the drums.	In fact, a debate over whether it could be economically beneficial to allow more travel abroad in the rest of Europe was held down, but in reality the debate over the issue – inevitably – didn't take any place at the moment.	In der Tat wurde in der Strathclyde-Vorlage auf die möglichen wirtschaftlichen Vorteile hingewiesen, die mehr Reisefreiheit im restlichen Europa mit sich bringen würde, doch spielte dies – erwartungsgemäß – in den Schlagzeilen keine Rolle.
1663	No one has mentioned that the EU member states frequently apply their strict rules when it's cheaper for them.	No one has mentioned that the EU countries often agree on their strict rules when it's cheaper for them.	No one has mentioned that the EU member states usually use their strict rules when it's cheaper for them.	Auch hat niemand erwähnt, dass sich die EU-Mitgliedsstaaten häufig ihre strikten Regeln zurechtbiegen, wenn es für sie günstiger ist.
1664	Since Schottland isn't to the Schengen Convention, the fortified non-proven right to Brussels was just a little more restrictive in order that to be really free from the Schotters.	Since Scotland hasn't been to the Convention of the Parties, the foregoing non-proclamation for Brussels would only be a small concession as opposed to what really is wanted from the Schots.	Since Schottland does not belong in the Schengen Convention, the permanent non-prohibition of Brussels would be a mere concession for what it really is wanted from the Schotten.	Da Schottland derzeit nicht zum Schengen-Raum gehört, wäre die fortgesetzte Nichtbeachtung für Brüssel nur ein kleines Zugeständnis im Gegenzug für das, was man wirklich von den Schotten will.
1665	No, not actually any stories.	No stories, actually.	Not really a story, either.	Also eigentlich keine Story.
1666	"And one who has already been gaining weight in years is that she already has an army of staff. This is the first time I heard ""Undependence = Passport Checks"" - entry recorded before at least 40 years ago."	"And one who's come to know it as early as possible is the very first time I heard ""Independence means Passport checkpoints"" (at least a year old)."	"And another who's already come in so early is laying off her oil as well. The first time I heard the ""Undependence means Passport Control"" sentence was before at least 40 years old."	"Und eine, die schon so in der Jahre gekommen ist, dass sie bereits einem Fossil gleicht: Das erste Mal habe ich die „Unabhängigkeit bedeutet Passkontrollen""-Ente vor mindestens 40 Jahren gehört."
1667	This is an interesting point in making repeated repetitions of this historic story.	This is an interesting point in a series of repetitions of this ancient history.	Obviously, a significant aspect of the repeated repetition of this classic story is an important point in keeping that historical tale alive.	Dabei geht ein interessanter Punkt beim ständigen Wiederholen dieser uralten Geschichte verloren.
1668	Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after European ice cream?	Why does one should expect that an independent Scotland would dance after the European fever?	Why should you expect a Scotland apart from the European Parliament to dance after the European Ppee?	Weshalb sollte man von einem unabhängigen Schottland erwarten, dass es nach der europäischen Pfeife tanzt?
1669	Why do people in London wear that pair, particularly now?	Why are the Londoner joes being exchanged for the ones in Brussels, particularly now?	Why is the Londoner Joke being traded against the Bridge, especially now?	Warum das Londoner Joch gegen das von Brüssel eintauschen, besonders jetzt?
1670	They're really European Neutralities: The large, after the war, plan for a union Europe was put up in stock.	Those are the real national news-the huge plan for union Europe was made up after WWII.	These are real European news: The long-running plan to unionize Europe, enacted after World War II, is being discussed in court.	Das sind die wirklichen europäischen Neuigkeiten: Der große, nach dem Krieg gefasste Plan zur Vereinigung Europas ist ins Stocken geraten.
1671	The Eurocrise took over the project Europe in its final stages.	The Eurocratic Union officially approved the proposal for Europe.	The project Europe was officially sanctioned by the European Union.	Mit der Eurokrise ist das Projekt Europa offiziell gestorben.
1672	A lot of EU member states win parties to land which they ultimately want to be EU members or the Euro as Europeans wish to join the Union.	All EU citizens win parties to territorial areas that are EU-financed, or to treaty as the euro zone.	Across the EU, all parties in the EU agree on land where they are in fact Union or want to throw the Euro as a non-member nation.	Überall in der EU gewinnen Parteien an Boden, die EU-feindlich sind oder den Euro als Gemeinschaftswährung über Bord werfen möchten.
1673	Even in Germany, the euro-sceptic Alternative for Germany – created only this year – was about five million votes in the Parliament elections in September, effectively removing the Free Democrates (the equivalent to that of the British Liberal Democrats) from the budget.	Even in Germany, the euroskeptical party Alternative for Germany – founded just this year – was effectively securing five million votes during the general election (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) and consequently the liberation movement as soon as possible.	Even in Germany, the euroskeptical alternative to Germany – not established until this year – had barely five million votes at the national election (equal to the UK Liberal Democrats) and by that time the LibDems defeated them as effectively as the Free Democrats were defeated on the federal level.	Selbst in Deutschland konnte die euroskeptische Partei Alternative für Deutschland – erst dieses Jahr gegründet – knapp fünf Millionen Stimmen bei der Bundestagswahl im September für sich ergattern und damit effektiv die Freien Demokraten (das Äquivalent zu den britischen Liberal Democrats) aus dem Bundestag vertreiben.
1674	There was always a lurid resistance to the plan to create an European federalist country.	There was a persistent resistance against the plan to create a European Union.	The plan to set up a federalist Europe was always opposed by a secret minority.	Es gab schon immer heimischen Widerstand gegen den Plan, ein föderalistisches Europa zu schaffen.
1675	Although the economic statement released is not necessarily a factor in the matter.	The latest economic forecast appears to be the decisive factor.	The current economic forecast is definitely a dead end.	Die aktuelle Wirtschaftskrise stellt sich allerdings als Wendepunkt heraus.
1676	A large number of people, considering the importance of Berlin and the European central bank, think that the project was too far in reaching.	Considering what the central bank and the European Union put in place to ensure strict Sparpolitik when they decide the specific economic policy which is necessary to achieve the common goal, many people believe that the project Europe was going too far.	The fact that Berlin and the European Central Bank adheres to a strict policy of cooperation with the bounds in which the national economy is regulated by the establishment of the Common Wage, many people think that the project Europe has gone too far.	Wegen der von Berlin und der Europäischen Zentralbank verhängten strengen Sparpolitik in Verbindung mit der Zwangsjacke, in die die jeweilige nationale Wirtschaft durch das Festhalten an der gemeinsamen Währung genötigt wird, sind viele Menschen der Ansicht, das Projekt Europa sei zu weit gegangen.
1677	The crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments enduring severe budgetary constraints – only in Greece was the case.	The monetary crisis has little to do with the failure of national governments to deal with the shortage of budgets – the only thing that was done in Greek was to prevent it from happening.	The crisis of the euro has nothing to do with the national governments struggling with budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.	Die Krise des Euro hat wenig damit zu tun, dass nationale Regierungen exzessive Haushaltsdefizite verursachen – das war nur in Griechenland der Fall.
1678	The rate of exchange rates among the Eurozone's members has been decided upon, which German exporters are planning to do, and German politicians want this to happen, too.	Moreover, the Eurozone has been emboldening its members to take part in trade negotiations with German exporters – and that's what German politicians wish to do so.	Moreover, the Eurosystem's members are actively engaged in trade – and many German politicians like this.	Stattdessen hat das Eurosystem seine Mitglieder auf Wechselkurse festgenagelt, die für deutsche Exporteure vorteilhaft sind – und das möchten deutsche Politiker gern so lassen.
1679	Without the possibility of a regional wage decline, South Europe is seen as having an unintended competitive advantage over Germany.	South Europe is again located in the region of the country which has a competitive advantage over Germany without the possibility of a localization's export.	Without the possibility of an aversion to local wage, South Europe with a reduced productivity profile sees itself as a new competitor to Germany.	Ohne die Möglichkeit einer Abwertung der lokalen Währung findet sich Südeuropa mit einem eingebauten Produktivitätsnachteil gegenüber Deutschland wieder.
1680	The only way to shorten speeches and public speeches is via Berlin.	The only way to reduce public and private ecstasy is from Berlin.	The only way to cut labor and public expenditure is via Berlin.	Die einzige Möglichkeit besteht darin, Löhne und öffentliche Ausgaben zu kürzen – angespornt von Berlin.
1681	Behind the current state of the union and the economic crisis lies a deeper problem of production in the European Union.	Behind the current state and wage problems is a deep-seated European productivity problem.	Behind the present state and employment problem is a deeper, regional-level production problem.	Hinter den aktuellen Etat- und Währungsproblemen liegt ein tiefer gehendes europäisches Produktivitätsproblem.
1682	The result of Brussels's green energy policies – an act to reduce subsidies for French and German energy companies on the costs of consumers – pays the European industrial sector the doubled in efficiency and the four times in gas.	After the green energy directives adopted in Brussels, which include the reduction of the cost of French and German energy companies, the European Union pays the double tax on electricity and the fourth for gas.	As a result of the Brussels-based green energy directives – a code for the concession of French and German energy companies to consumers – the EU industrial industry compares the United States' double for electricity and the US Virgin Islands' fourth for gas.	"Als Folge der von Brüssel verordneten „grünen"" Energierichtlinien – ein Code für die Subventionierung französischer und deutscher Energieunternehmen auf Kosten der Verbraucher – zahlt die europäische Industrie verglichen mit den Vereinigten Staaten das Doppelte für Elektrizität und das Vierfache für Gas."
1683	It's a small cost, as we had seen from the side of the road.	That's a minor inconvenience, as we were able to see in Grangemouth.	It's a cost-effective alternative, as we had been able to see it at the mouth of the creek already.	Das ist ein lähmender Kostennachteil, wie wir bereits in Grangemouth sehen konnten.
1684	The global trade unions are not protecting the industrialized country from rising prices.	All the world's splinter lists warn the European industrial sector against getting caught in the crossfire of the United States.	All lanes on the planet don't protect the europaeco-produce industries from being influenced by the American gridlock.	Alle Lohnfestschreibungen der Welt schützen die europäische petrochemische Industrie nicht davor, von billigem amerikanischem Schiefergas in die Ecke gedrängt zu werden.
1685	A revolution is on the way, particularly in France, where the EU was founded.	As a result, a revolt is starting to take hold, particularly in France, which is the founding leader of the EU.	A revolt inevitably occurs, especially in France, which is leading the EU by storm.	Als Folge zieht eine Revolte herauf, besonders in Frankreich, dem einstigen Cheerleader der EU.
1686	After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a caricature; it was with Germany that they could hold their breath and Washington them at eye level.	After World War 2 the elite political class in France saw the EU as a cross, between Germany and Washington at ground level.	After WW2 the elite of France saw the EU as a hybrid, where Germany could be tense and Paris could be brought up with Washington.	Nach dem Krieg sah die politische Elite Frankreichs die EU als ein Vehikel, mit dem man Deutschland in Schach halten und Paris auf Augenhöhe mit Washington heben konnte.
1687	However, Berlin doesn't need Paris more than the Tor for political legitimacy and has pressed on with his own economic policy, which criticized the struggling French economy.	But Berlin doesn't need Paris anymore than a platform for political legitimacy and Europa has put on its own economic policy, which has driven the struggling French economy.	Paris doesn't need a place on the political scene, and Europe has pressed ahead with its own economic policy whose impact it has on the already struggling French economy.	Doch Berlin braucht Paris nicht mehr als Tor zur politischen Legitimation und hat Europa seine eigene Wirtschaftspolitik aufgedrückt, womit die angeschlagene französische Wirtschaft zu kämpfen hat.
1688	The result: Against the Constitution, Marine Le Pen won the European front-runner.	The result was that the criminal justice group in question, European Front National, won a decisive election and with it handed over to the ruling Socialisms to their peers at number three.	The result: Against Marine Le Pen, the EU-supported Front National has won a decisive election and, therefore, the ruling communists occupy three spots.	Das Ergebnis: Marine Le Pens rechtsgerichteter, EU-feindlicher Front National hat gerade eine entscheidende Nachwahl gewonnen und damit die regierenden Sozialisten auf Platz drei verwiesen.
1689	The Front National is the second-largest party in France, with 25 percent of the vote. This is timely reminder for the British Labour Party not to go away as it can mean benefits to the Link.	The Front National is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote. A timely warning for the British Labour Party that she can't proceed without mentioning that a correct spelling would mean good luck to the left.	The Front National is the most popular party in France, with 24 per cent of the vote – an accurate warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot take advantage of the move, which would automatically benefit Linke.	Der Front National ist nun die beliebteste Partei in Frankreich mit 24 Prozent der Wählerstimmen – eine zeitgerechte Warnung für die britische Labour-Partei, dass sie nicht davon ausgehen kann, eine Spaltung im rechten Spektrum würde automatisch Vorteile für die Linke bedeuten.
1690	How does Pen win their popularity amongst white workers?	What's the new popularity of the pen among white workers?	What's a newcomer for the white-language workers with their newly acquired popularity?	Was macht Le Pen mit ihrer neu gewonnen Popularität unter den weißen Franzosen der Arbeiterklasse?
1691	She wants to use the EU waiver next year to block an anti-EU, anti-European election in the European Parliament.	She'd like to use the EUWave next year to make up a blockade against the EU, an anti-EU measure and an anti-member state ban on EU parliament.	She would like to use the EU referendum next year to block the passage of an anti-EU, anti-democratic vote at the European Parliament.	Sie möchte die EU-Wahlen nächstes Jahr dazu nutzen, einen Anti-EU-, Anti-Gemeinschaftswährungsblock im Europäischen Parlament zu schmieden.
1692	If the pro-EU parties are well represented in these elections – and that is very good possibility – then such a bloc could become the european parliament for the first time.	If anti-EU parties are properly represented in these elections — and that is very likely to happen, then it may become the first block to dominate the European Parliament.	If the anti-EU party is involved in these elections well - and it's very likely that it would, then this block could finally be dominating.	Falls die Anti-EU-Parteien bei diesen Wahlen gut abschneiden – und das ist sehr gut möglich –, dann könnte erstmals ein solcher Block das Europäische Parlament dominieren.
1693	That's the point beyond which I wish: In far future, the growing opposition to the EU and the common effort to abstain from the Euro will not remain the same.	This is the point on which I intend to concentrate : In not far distant future, the growing anger toward the EU and the common effort to end euro will not cease.	This is the point that I want to discuss: In not very long future, the growing anger against EU and the common effort to end the Euro will not disappear.	Dies ist der Punkt, auf den ich hinaus will: In nicht allzu ferner Zukunft wird das wachsende Ressentiment gegen die EU und die gemeinsame Währung sich zur Abschaffung des Euro zusammenfinden.
1694	"The EU will not disappear, but it'll soon become as much like ""The European Union of sovereign nations"" which General de Gaulle favored."	"The EU will not disappear, but in a way the ""Europa of the USSR which General de Gaulle encouraged"" is going to soon change."	"The EU won't disappear, but it will soon become similar to the ""Europa of sovereign nations"", which General de Gaulle favoured."	"Die EU wird nicht verschwinden, aber sie wird eher so etwas wie das „Europa der (souveränen) Nationen"" werden, das General de Gaulle favorisierte."
1695	Germany and a few of its satellite networks may meet at Eurovision, but France and southern Europe will return to their own rules.	Germany and a few of his satellite networks may be at odds with the Euro, but France and South-eastern countries are returning to their own ways.	Germany and a couple of his satellites might have an effect on the euro, but France and Europe will return to their own continents.	Deutschland und ein paar seiner Satelliten-Wirtschaften halten vielleicht am Euro fest, aber Frankreich und Südeuropa werden zu ihren eigenen Währungen zurückkehren.
1696	I expect that the British people involved in this project will lose faith in the USA.	I hoped that the UK could disavaise this project in hopes of establishing itself in the United States.	I'm expecting that the UK government will give in to this project in hope they will settle with the USA.	Ich erwarte, dass sich Großbritannien von diesem Projekt distanziert in der Hoffnung, sich bei den USA einzuschmeicheln.
1697	However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic.	However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests a single nation will represent atlantians.	However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific Ocean suggests that it will be possible to lead a nation alone in Atlantic wind.	Allerdings legt Washingtons wachsendes Interesse am Pazifikraum nahe, dass Großbritannien allein im atlantischen Regen stehen wird.
1698	Where is Scotland all of a sudden?	Where is Scotland all the way?	Where will Scotsland stay?	Wo bleibt Schottland bei all dem?
1699	We can decide to be a region of (in the end) small-country.	We can decide to be a small-scale region (and in the end, small-scale).	We can decide to be the region of (in this sense) low-lying nations.	Wir können entscheiden, eine Region von (in letzter Konsequenz) Klein-England zu sein.
1700	Or we can defend our own economic interests – what it means to both Berlin and Brussels to say what they can do.	Or we can defend our own economic interests - how about telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do to themselves, for example.	Or we can defend our own economic interests, how about saying Berlin and Brussels what they can do.	Oder wir können unsere eigenen wirtschaftlichen Interessen verteidigen – wozu auch gehört, Berlin und Brüssel zu sagen, was sie sich wo hinstecken können.
1701	I think it's quite possible to travel in Europe apart from the norm, if we keep our own way.	I imagine that Scotland could make the very best use of a less crowded European region if we keep our own customs.	I imagine that Scotland could be a good neighbour in a long-term European union, as long as we keep our own way.	Ich vermute, Schottland könnte in einem lockereren europäischen Verbund ganz gut fahren, sofern wir unsere eigene Währung behalten.
1702	Cooperation with other similar thinkers is not easy in a free Europe.	Cooperating with other similar thought-provoking countries is not easier in a more frequent European Union.	Coordination with other similar countries is not easier in a European Union that is more developed.	Die Kooperation mit anderen, ähnlich denkenden Ländern ist in einem nicht föderierten Europa der Nationen einfacher.
1703	We should try to keep our economic independence.	In general, we should consider maintaining our independence.	On the other hand, we must consider retaining our economic independence.	Ansonsten sollten wir erwägen, es Norwegen gleichzutun und unsere wirtschaftliche Unabhängigkeit behalten.
1704	SNP-Regional in Scotland is, by far, the most successful political movement against the Sparta policy in Europe, winning a huge majority on account of the defeat of the Labour government's Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition with the Tory/Librecy government.	SNP in Scotland is the most successful political movement against the USSR and achieved a spectre of majority achieved through the removal of the disastrous (and potentially fatal) coalition measures that Labour's former Finance minister Alistair Darling and subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition to respond to.	The SNP region in Scotland is, in the most notable way, the most successful political campaign against the syrofacial government in Europe, winning a significant majority in 2011, as evidenced by the failure of Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and subsequent Tory Liberal coalition (TLD) coalition to answer.	Die SNP-Regierung in Schottland ist – bemerkenswerterweise – die erfolgreichste politische Bewegung gegen die Sparpolitik in Europa und hat 2011 eine spektakuläre Mehrheit aufgrund der Ablehnung der vorgeschlagenen (und vorgenommenen) Kürzungen gewonnen, die der Labour-Finanzminister Alistair Darling und die nachfolgende Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition zu verantworten hatten.
1705	Schottland would be foolish to decide on a dependency only then to get an extension of Berlin and Brussels.	Schottland is illegitime to decide in fact only to get a Spar policy then achieved by Berlin and Brussels.	It would be wrong for the country to decide on a dependency only then to get a peace agreement between Berlin and Brussels.	Es wäre für Schottland lächerlich, sich jetzt für eine Unabhängigkeit zu entscheiden, nur um dann von Berlin und Brüssel eine Sparpolitik aufgezwungen zu bekommen.
1706	FAA: Air passengers can now use electronic devices in planes (but not for mobile phones).	FAA: Pilots can now use electronic devices in airplanes (for example, don't let mobile phones talk).	FAA: Pilots can now use electronic devices in airplanes (without mobile phone chat).	FAA: Fluggäste können jetzt elektronische Geräte in Flugzeugen verwenden (aber keine Handygespräche führen)
1707	For travelers who travel by sea, including to Landing their electronic devices for reading, working, listening music, and watching movies, it can't but use mobile phones, such as the new directives issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on December 27th.	Those flying from the departure point to landing can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, listening, and watching movies. Or they can only do so via the mobile telephone, as the Federal Aviation Administration issued new guidelines on Thursday.	Traveling on board can use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies in the comfort of their mobile phone, as the U.S.Faq issued new directives on Tuesday.	Flugreisende können jetzt vom Abflug bis zur Landung ihre elektronischen Geräte zum Lesen, Arbeiten, Spielen, Musik hören und dem Ansehen von Filmen verwenden, nicht aber mit dem Handy telefonieren, so die neuen Richtlinien, die am Donnerstag von der Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in den USA herausgegeben wurden.
1708	But not the travelers should expect that these changes will be immediately implemented.	But the travellers shouldn't expect that these changes will be immediately implemented.	But the Portuguese shouldn't expect this change to be implemented immediately.	Doch sollten die Passagiere nicht erwarten, dass diese Änderungen sofort umgesetzt werden.
1709	How quickly they would implement depends on the company concerned, said FAA-worker Michael Huerta speaking to a press conference.	How quickly they would be implemented, depending on the carrier, explained FAA's Michael Huerta to a press conference.	How fast it would be implemented depends on the respective airline, said head FAA economist Michael Huerta in a press conference.	Wie schnell sie implementiert würden, hinge von der jeweiligen Fluggesellschaft ab, erklärte FAA-Mitarbeiter Michael Huerta auf einer Pressekonferenz.
1710	The airlines need to prove that the new rules are right and that they update the Handbooks for the handling of the aircraft in accordance with the new rules as well.	The airlines must prove that they have followed the new regulations and that their manuals to the effecting of the new rules and the rules for carrying out the machines in accordance with the new rules have been updated.	They must convince the FAA that they have followed all the new regulations and updated the instruction manual for passengers and maintenance procedures in accordance with the new rules.	Die Fluggesellschaften müssen der FAA nachweisen, dass Flugzeuge den neuen Richtlinien entsprechen und dass sie die Schulungshandbücher des Flugpersonals sowie die Regelungen für das Verstauen der Geräte entsprechend der neuen Vorschriften aktualisiert haben.
1711	The FAA said that she already received plans from some airlines for using electronic devices in aircraft.	The FAA said that she had already been granted plans by some airlines which intended to use electronic devices in planes.	The FAA said that she'd already been granted plans by several airline companies to use handheld electronic devices in planes.	Die FAA erklärte, sie habe bereits von einigen Fluggesellschaften Pläne erhalten, die den Einsatz tragbarer elektronischer Geräte in Flugzeugen ausbauen möchten.
1712	Those airlines also operated as Delta and United.	There were also Delta and JetBlue in this group.	There were also Delta and JetBlue on board these airlines.	Unter diesen Fluggesellschaften waren auch Delta und JetBlue.
1713	Considering the plan, we could soon allow for the use of electronic devices, the FAA said.	The FAA said that it was rumouring that it might be possible to encourage the use of electronic devices very soon.	"""Now that the plan is going to be accepted, we could use e-readers very soon,"" the FAA said in response."	"„Je nach Zustand des Plans könnten wir die erweiterte Nutzung elektronischer Geräte sehr bald genehmigen"", gab die FAA in einer Verlautbarung bekannt."
1714	It'll be necessary to turn off mobile devices, tablets and other devices when the aircraft door doors are closed.	At that moment, all mobile phones, tablets and other electronic devices need to be turned off when the plane doors are shut.	At the same time, it is necessary to turn off mobile phones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.	Derzeit müssen Passagiere Smartphones, Tablets und andere Geräte abschalten, wenn die Flugzeugtüren geschlossen werden.
1715	They can't start again until the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gets green light.	They can't put on their own until the airplane is three kilometres in height and the captain is lit with green light.	You can't start them until there's a further three kilometres when the plane has reached a maximum of three meters and the capitant's grey light.	Sie dürfen sie erst dann wieder starten, wenn das Flugzeug eine Höhe von drei Kilometern erreicht hat und der Kapitän grünes Licht gibt.
1716	When entering the country flight, the passengers must again turn off and they are not to start again until the plane has landed.	They need to switch on the landing plane, and cannot start again until it is landed.	On landing, the airline passengers need to switch off again and shouldn't start again once they've landed the plane.	Beim Eintritt in den Landeanflug müssen die Fluggäste sie wieder abschalten und dürfen sie nicht wieder starten, ehe das Flugzeug gelandet ist.

"Häußler stellte klar: ""Die letztendlichen Entscheidungen fällen die Mitglieder des Gemeinderats""."
1798	The flood, which happened on May the 15th, was not prepared for a major event and raised the question of future measures, as usual.	The spill, which occurred on May 15th, 2009, did not cause a spill, but was significant enough to raise the question of future safeguards, so a weatherman.	The flood, sprained in the 15th of 2009, was an extremely grave event that raised the question of future protection measures, as many have said.	Das Hochwasser, das Gechingen am 15. Mai 2009, unvorbereitet traf, sei ein einschneidendes Ereignis gewesen, das die Frage nach Schutzmaßnahmen für die Zukunft aufwarf, so Häußler.
1799	A flood area search was undertaken in collaboration with the neighbourhood of Aidlingen, which now forms the basis for the concept of flood control in Geching.	The town of Addington had the task of carrying out a drainage area surveying, which is now the basis for the project to apply it in Gechingen.	A flood control plan was made in cooperation with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which now makes up the ground for the flood defence scheme in Goshen.	Eine Flussgebietsuntersuchung war mit der Nachbargemeinde Aidlingen in Auftrag gegeben worden, die nun Grundlage für das Hochwasserschutzkonzept in Gechingen ist.
1800	To protect a lot of land from development, said Häudler.	Towards a lot of safer land is the goal, says Häute.	The goal is to protect as much of the land as possible, say builders.	"""Der Schutz möglichst vieler bebauter Grundstücke ist das Ziel"", so Häußler."
1801	The timing of the twilight period is planning for several hundred years to expect high water, according to a German Weather Service.	A major snag was planning the protection against floods for the past hundred years, as a German weather service reported.	The plan for the protection against floods reportedly went into effect at the end of the century when a German weather service said that it had forecasted all future high water to be expected.	Zugrunde gelegt ist der Planung der Schutz vor einem laut Deutschen Wetterdienst statistisch alle 100 Jahre zu erwartenden Hochwasser.
1802	The climate change is managed on a 15-pronged scale.	The change in the climate will be covered by a 15-pronged solution.	The climate change is being reflected in a fifteen-prozend bill.	Der Klimaveränderung wird durch einen 15-prozentigen Zuschlag Rechnung getragen.
1803	"In technical circles, the term ""HQ 100a-Klime"" is called."	"The technical term is ""HQ 100aKlimak"" in trade circles."	"In the trade group, ""HQ 100-a-Klimat"" is referred to."	"In Fachkreisen wird dies mit ""HQ 100aKlima"" bezeichnet."
1804	The watermass which caused heavy damage in Gechen caused a 1,000-year flood.	The floods caused by the flooding in 2009 have amounted to 20,000 years of water.	The watermass that caused heavy flooding in 2009 described a 1000-year flood.	Die Wassermassen, die 2009 in Gechingen zu beträchtlichen Schäden geführt hatten, entsprachen einem 1000-jährigen Hochwasser.
1805	There is not absolutely no protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, says Häuser.	It is not possible to give absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, says Hammond.	There is no absolute protection, but there can be some relative improvement, says Häusler.	"""Einen absoluten Schutz gibt es nicht, aber eine relative Verbesserung können wir erzielen"", so Häußler."
1806	To achieve the 100 acclaim of Q1100, you'll need to invest about four million euros, and the community can be counted as much as 70 percent to contribute to total cost of land acquisition.	To achieve the security at HHQ 100aKlimam, around four million euros must be invested in local taxes, wherein the city's total expenditure of about 70 percent can be considered a factor.	To achieve HQ 100aKlima, the community needs to invest around four million euro (the council can budget about 60 percent for local expenditures).	Um den Schutz HQ 100aKlima zu erzielen, müssen in Gechingen rund vier Millionen Euro investiert werden, wobei die Gemeinde mit Landeszuschüssen in Höhe von rund 70 Prozent rechnen kann.
1807	However, some complain that they only want it if a total plan is implemented.	Some people insist that it only needs to be backed by a comprehensive plan.	Observers complain that the promotion only happens when there's a complete plan to be implemented.	Häußler wies aber darauf hin, dass es die Förderung nur gebe, wenn ein Gesamtkonzept umgesetzt werde.
1808	That's why the municipality was given the right to the affect of people.	This resulted in the council considering the impact of local citizens.	The town was given the power to affect the population by this decision.	Dazu sei die Gemeinde auf die Mitwirkung der Bürger angewiesen.
1809	A planning and consent process is to be completed at once.	A detailed planning and approval process must be completed.	Planning and approving procedures must be completed in advance.	Ein aufwändiges Planungs- und Genehmigungsverfahren müsse absolviert werden.
1810	In the best case, 2016 could be started with implementation.	In the best case, 2016 should start with the implementation.	I'm sure that 2016 will start with the implementation.	Im besten Fall könne 2016 mit der Umsetzung begonnen werden.
1811	Among these are the measures already proposed in the past week by the council (we reported local measures on the tributary bank).	The other side sees the protection plan presented in the town council last week, we have reported local measures being put into place in the direction of the tributary valley.	Under this, the protection plan has been put forward by the town hall already last week (we reported) local measures in the floodwater basin from the Stammheim region.	Unter anderem sieht das Schutzkonzept, das bereits in der vergangenen Woche im Gemeinderat präsentiert wurde (wir berichteten) lokale Maßnahmen im Zufluss des Flüsschens Irm aus dem Stammheimer Tal vor.
1812	In the wake of the presentation on the concept of enforestation, participants had the chance to raise their concerns.	Following the presentation on the theme of water and flood prevention, participants used the opportunity to introduce their concerns.	Following presentation of the high water concept, participants were given the opportunity to present their concerns.	Im Anschluss an die Präsentation des Hochwasserschutzkonzepts nutzten die Teilnehmer die Gelegenheit, ihre Anliegen einzubringen.
1813	It was asked why there were not any more rivers and streams that would protect the ocean from being drained.	A number of reasons have been put forward why there are no longer dams and watercourses planned to protect the ortes.	The issue of why there were no more pools and ponds planned for protection against the birds was raised further.	Unter anderem wurde in Frage gestellt, warum nicht mehr Dämme und Rückhaltebecken zum Schutz des Ortes geplant seien.
1814	Gregor Kün, manager of the project responsible for the design of the department of forest and cobwebs in Hedgeheim, highlighted it was necessary to combine all the measures presented to achieve the desired result.	Gregor Kühn, project manager at the department of forest and cobwebs in Heidelberg, highlighted the need for all the measures being proposed to reach the desired goal.	Gregor Kün, the lead engineer for the project Wald and Corbe, emphasised that all the measures proposed were necessary to achieve the desired end.	Gregor Kühn, Fachplaner des beauftragten Ingenieurbüros Wald und Corbe aus Hügelsheim, der das Konzept vorstellte, betonte, dass es das Zusammenspiel aller vorgestellten Maßnahmen benötige, um in der Summe das gewünschte Ziel zu erreichen.
1815	Then the economic solution, as Joachim's forest of wood and corn was halted to be found.	More importantly, the economic solution was to find such a thing as John's forest of dead leaves and corbs.	Darüber hinaus, the most economical solution was kept to find, so John Walden and Corbe.	Darüber hinaus sei man gehalten die wirtschaftlichste Lösung zu finden, so Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
1816	Fear ruled over those loyal to those who have been victims of a normal flood again falling through a strain of the canal.	Angers of elders who, when they speak, are always subjected to a breakdown in their network.	Anger was common among those who, as they were preparing themselves, would always have a strain on their nerves.	Unmut herrschte bei Anliegern des Altorts, die selbst bei normalen Gewitterregen immer wieder unter einer Überlastung des Kanalnetzes zu leiden haben.
1817	The problem is known from the start and first steps have been taken.	The problem is well known, and first steps have been taken.	The problem is well known in the administration and first measures have already been taken.	Das Problem ist bei der Verwaltung bekannt und erste Maßnahmen wurden bereits ergriffen.
1818	Nevertheless, some complainants insist that the rules for canal systems are different to those for high water safety and they won't be enforced.	Observers however argue that the guidelines for canals are not as strict as those for flood control and don't be enforced.	Those who violate the above regulations must be careful that they are not following the rules for canals otherwise suitable to use as a barrier and cannot be used to carry out the above requirements.	Häußler wies jedoch darauf hin, dass die Richtlinien für Kanalsysteme andere seien, als für den Hochwasserschutz und dies nicht vermischt werden dürfe.
1819	The municipality was obliged to build the canal network so as to prevent the need for two – three years of flooding.	The municipality has been obliged to set up the canal network so that two – three years of rain are not permitted.	The community is bound to ensure the canal network can last two or three years.	Die Gemeinde sei verpflichtet, das Kanalnetz so auszulegen, dass zwei- bis dreijährige Regenereignisse verkraftet werden könnten.
1820	It would take millions to scale up the oceans.	If the oceans were bigger, millions of people would disappear.	The oceans are bigger to be a seaside basin, they would swallow millions.	Die Abwasserkanäle größer zu dimensionieren, würde Millionen verschlingen.

Als Déjà Vu bezeichnet man laut Lexikon ein psychologisches Phänomen, das sich in dem Gefühl äußert, eine neue Situation schon einmal erlebt oder gesehen zu haben.
1825	The visit of the same café opposite the college-run high school in the vicinity should not be used during periods of intense heat and abrasive cold weather.	It does not have to stay in the same block of coffeeshops across the campus from where the University of Rhine-Westphalia is located because it is not necessary to stay in the cold.	If you visit the same café on the Avenue in the Town Centre or near the University of Rhein-Westphalia, you don't need to stay in the cold when you go inside to the university.	Im Falle des Besuchs des gleichnamigen Cafés am Opschlag in der Kreisstadt Kleve in Sichtweite zur Hochschule Rhein-Waal muss es nicht beim reinen Déjà Vu-Gefühl bleiben.
1826	Ultimately, the name of the café is exactly the goal: making a real stay that does not only mean you should regret it, but also one you can make sure you are back again and again.	In fact, the café with its lovely name is exactly what it was meant: not only does the coffee shop deserve to be rated down but also be used repeatedly.	In the end, that lovely name was just right: a really relaxing stay did not only need to be noted, but also an enjoyable and memorable return.	Schließlich hat das Café mit dem schönen Namen genau das zum Ziel: einen tatsächlichen Aufenthalt nicht nur gedanklich, sondern handfest immer wiederkehrend erlebbar zu machen.
1827	It is easy to get lost in the way.	It's really fun and simply beautiful.	It's just fun and really nice.	Weil's eben Spaß macht und einfach schön ist.

1836	Quite a lot of young students here would like to look just as attractive as senior citizens and all the age groups.	Both young students here would like to look and feel just as attracted to both peers and senior citizens of all ages.	Rather than the two young students here, I would like to look just as much as any senior or all age groups.	Vielmehr möchte die beiden hier junge Studenten genauso ansprechen wie Senioren und alle Altersklassen dazwischen.

"Maybe Daniel Büttler isn't the least person that's an enthusiastic fan of event-organisers: ""You shouldn't be all wrong now."""	"Vielleicht ist Daniel Büttner auch deswegen kein ausgesprochener Fan von Event-Abenden: ""Man kann's ja nun mal nicht allen Recht machen""."

1860	The tailwind bends around the seat width that passengers are offered to on long flights in the tourism class – not always the seats which airlines use, but this section of the new airplanes by Airbus is the key that airlines have to negotiate with Boeing and Airbus.	The stall is round the wide aisle offered to travellers on long journeys in the Tourist Class – not always the seats offered to the airlines that are most likely to be used, but this extra-wide space sets up the keypad for the effective declaration of Airbus and Boeing Co.’s new aircraft.	The staircase turns around the seat – which passengers are offered in the tourist class but it isn't always the seats to which airlines try out; this section is the key to carrying out the efficiency checks on the new Airbus A350-E and Boeing A380, but it provides the key for the efficient operation of Airbus S.A.S.	Der Streit dreht sich um die Sitzbreite, die Passagieren bei langen Flügen in der Touristenklasse angeboten wird – nicht immer diejenigen, um die sich Fluggesellschaften am meisten bemühen, doch dieser ausgewiesene Raum stellt den Schlüssel für die Effizienzbehauptungen bei den neuesten Flugzeugen von Airbus SAS und Boeing Co. dar.

1872	The mean height of the United States in the period twenty-first is a scale of one hundred and eight cm, according to US-American health statistics.	According to the US-American health statistics, the average length of men in the 21st century is 100,8 cm.

Der Taillenumfang des männlichen Durchschnittsamerikaners im 21. Jahrhundert beträgt laut US-amerikanischen Gesundheitsstatistiken 100,8 cm.
1873	"Airbus says their rival's chair design is inspired by the 1950s, when the average weight of the newly-designed ""Jet Set"" was about the same."	"Airbus says its Rivale reflects a design from the 1950s when the average height of the newly-launched ""Job set"" is slightly larger."	"Airbus says its Rivale takes inspiration from the 1950s when the average body volume of the freshly commissioned ""Jet Set"" is about the same."	"Airbus sagt, sein Rivale halte sich an ein Sitzkonzept aus den 1950ern, als der durchschnittliche Körperumfang des frisch getauften „Jet Set"" schmaler war."
1874	The company that operated, Airbus, found that adding another ten inches (2,54 cm) would lower the sleep quality by 53 percent.	According to Airbus, the study found that an additional foot (2,54 cm) per seat lowers the comfort of the occupant by 53 percent.	Airbus conducted studies that found an additional pillow (2,54 cm) lowered the sleep quality by 53 percent.	Man habe, so Airbus, Untersuchungen durchgeführt, die belegten, dass ein zusätzliches Zoll (2,54 cm) pro Sitz die Schlafqualität um 53 Prozent steigere.
1875	Boeing disagrees with the number of employees at Airbus's meetings and says that it is not in their best interest to decide how airlines balance tarfa and facilities.	Boeing is denying the measurements of Airbus's seats and says that it is not within their power to decide how airline companies manage the balance between flight and security.	Boeing is denying the number of seats in Airbus and says that it is not in the manufacture's best interest to decide how airline companies balance between flight decks and operations.	Boeing bestreitet die Zahlen von Airbus zu den Sitzmaßen und sagt, es stehe nicht im Ermessen der Hersteller zu entscheiden, wie Fluggesellschaften die Balance zwischen Flugtarifen und Einrichtung gestalten.
1876	The company, explaining that according to research, the experience on board is wider than the seat height.	The company, also, explained that it's a lot of fun to travel in an airplane more than the seats.	The company has explained the experience in the plane goes further than the seat width, too.	Das Unternehmen erklärt auch, laut Untersuchungen hänge das Erlebnis im Flugzeug von mehr als der Sitzbreite ab.
1877	It really depends on giving the companies flexibility to do so they can be able to achieve what they want to, explained the flight engineer at Boeing, Kent Cronin of BAT.	It really depends on giving flexibility to the airlines so that they can do what they think is necessary to be successful, explained the aviation expert Kent Craver of Boeing.	It really depends on the flexibility of the airlines so that they can do what he or she thinks is necessary to be successful, says engineer Mark Cramer from Boeing.	"„Es läuft wirklich darauf hinaus, Fluggesellschaften Flexibilität zu geben, damit sie das tun können, was sie ihrer Ansicht nach müssen, um erfolgreich zu sein"", erläutert der Flugkabinenexperte Kent Craver von Boeing."
1878	They don't want us to dictate what she can profit from.	You don't want us to dictate what she makes money on.	They don't want us to dictate what they can profit from.	Sie möchten nicht, dass wir ihnen diktieren, was sie profitabel macht.
1879	They know her shop better than anyone else does.	You know her shop better than anybody else.	You know their business better than anyone else.	Sie kennen ihr Geschäft besser als jeder andere.
1880	For passengers, there's a greater freedom of speech, but for producers it's becoming an increasingly important subject to be considered in terms of the implementation.	"For airline passengers, the subject of ""electronics"" is getting more and more important, but for manufacturers, it's becoming a subject which can be put to use."	Architects are more likely to opt for umbrellas, but manufacturers are increasingly turning to them as topics.	Für Fluggäste geht es um mehr Ellenbogenfreiheit, aber für Hersteller wird es in zunehmendem Maße ein Thema, das sich auf die Umsätze auswirken kann.
1881	Behind the backdrop is a series of competitions for commercial aircraft in the next few decades valued at at least 700 billion US dollars, which could lead to an impact on the export of the United States or Europe.	In the adversity is a race of runways designed to produce aircraft with a nominal value of at least 700 billion US dollar during the next few decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export of America or Europe.	There's a race to develop new aircraft with an estimated value of mindestens 700 billion US dollars in the future, which could result in an impact on the export of US or European countries.	Hinter der Auseinandersetzung steht ein Rennen um Flugzeugbestellungen mit einem geschätzten Volumen von mindestens 700 Milliarden US-Dollar nach Listenpreisen in den kommenden Jahrzehnten, was sich nachhaltig auf die Exportbilanz der USA oder Europas auswirken könnte.
1882	As first reported in July, the paper revealed that the floor plan was the driving force behind the merger with the new jet.	As was reported in July, the paper for the first time says the meeting's floor is the deciding factor behind the switch to the new jet.	Reuters reported for the first time this month that the seat layout was driving force behind the merger of the new jets.	Wie Reuters im Juli erstmals berichtete, ist das Sitzlayout die treibende Kraft hinter der Auseinandersetzung um die neuen Jets.
1883	Both Airbus and Boeing say they are using up to 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their new two speed plane than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 747-300ER, which has three offices in Atlanta.	Both Airbus and Boeing say they are saving 20 percent a year on their latest two-motorized aircraft than the market leader in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER, which is based in London.	Airbus and Boeing both promise to achieve 20 % savings a day on their new twin engine-powered bus than the market leader in that segment, Boeing 777-300ER.	Sowohl Airbus als auch Boeing behaupten 20 Prozent mehr Effizienz pro Sitz bei ihren neuesten zweimotorigen Langstreckendesigns als der Marktführer in diesem Segment, die 365-sitzige Boeing 77-300ER.
1884	The results in the Boeing result partially depend on the fact that the 777X has its ten seats, and the original design of nine seats in the 777 is to be compared with the original design of the original design.	The evidence attributed to the results of the Boeing 747 is largely based on the fact that the 777X will be compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.	The results of the audit may be influenced by the idea that the Boeing 777X will come with its ten seats and, in fact, nine seats.	Die Aussagen Boeings zu den Ergebnissen hängen teilweise davon ab, dass die 777X mit ihren zehn Sitzen pro Reihe mit dem Originaldesign von neun Sitzen in der 777 verglichen wird.
1885	The cost per unit has remained lower than in the past for machines with ten seats.	The cost of the unit increased more by the same than for current uses with ten seats.	The cost of unit has remained lower than for the current generation machines with ten seats.	Die gestiegenen Kosten pro Einheit sind immer noch geringer als bei derzeit verwendeten Maschinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe.
1886	Boeing therefore gets more seats in his plane to be able to compete with our products, says Kevin Keniston of the European Airbus head of passenger comfort.	Because of the weather, Boeing keeps fewer seats in his plane so that it can be competitive with our products,” says Kevin Keniston, manager for passenger comfort at European Airlines.	"By flying faster in his plane it makes more difficult to make our products competitive,"" says Kevin Keniston, manager of passenger comfort at Europe Airbus."	"„Boeing quetscht deshalb mehr Sitze in sein Flugzeug, um es wettbewerbsfähiger zu unseren Produkten zu machen"", sagt Kevin Keniston, Leiter für Passagierkomfort bei der europäischen Airbus."
1887	Similarly, analysts saying full-size cabins with ten seats in the existing 777 were arguing that much passenger demand would determine what cheaper air fare might be.	Meanwhile, analysts say that full seats on the 777 resulted in a decision by many passengers to go with the cheaper airfare.	Analysts say that full cabins with ten seats on the existing 777 resulted in the need to decide whether they could or might not carry much passenger luggage.	Andererseits sagen Analysten, volle Kabinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe bei vorhandenen 777s deuteten darauf hin, dass sich viele Passagiere für die engere Anordnung entschieden, was mit billigeren Flugtarifen einhergehen könnte.
1888	The aisles are large enough for passengers, but the practicality is that the Airbus offer of the bed and board through the 777 is attractive on the economic side, says Mary Kirby, founder and executive director at Runway Girl Network.	The number of seats available is impressive, but the practicality is that the Airbus offering from the start to the end is highly competitive, says Mary Kirby, CEO and founder at Runway Girl Network.	The ten square-metre seats would be ideal for tourists, but the practicality is that in a competitive sense, the A380 is controlled by Mary Kirby, executive director of Kabineneinrichtung and co-founder of Runway Girl Network.	"„Achtzehn Zoll Sitzbreite wären toll für Passagiere, aber die Wirklichkeit ist: von einem wirtschaftlichen Gesichtspunkt aus ist das Airbus-Angebot von der Bedrohung durch die 777 gesteuert"", sagt Mary Kirby, Expertin für Kabineneinrichtung, Gründerin und Herausgeberin von Runway Girl Network."
1889	Airbus and Boeing don't offer seats, but instead a directory of suppliers whom the airlines can draw from.	Airbus and Boeing don't offer meetings; instead, they provide a catalogue of suppliers which the airlines can use.	Airbus and Boeing don't offer seats, sondern a directory of suppliers which the airlines can obtain from.	Airbus und Boeing bieten keine Sitze an, sondern einen Katalog von Zulieferern, aus denen die Fluggesellschaften auswählen können.
1890	The welt-travelling jet liners are even more careful to measure their equipment in order to compete with others.	The traveler jet sellers are so concerned they are comparing the performance of their products against the competition.	The typhoons who travel abroad take a lot of measures to try to set themselves apart from the competition.	Die weltreisenden Jet-Verkäufer tragen sogar Bandmaß bei sich, um die Einrichtung bei der Konkurrenz nachzumessen.
1891	Even though you pay for the convenience, all of these manufacturers offer jets with highly rated layouts for charter flights and regional flights.	Even though they charge a premium to the comfort, all jet manufacturers offer more expensive options for both domestic and regional flights.	Even though they offer the best in terms of comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with more extensive options for both domestic and regional flights.	Selbst wenn sie den Komfort anpreisen, so bieten doch alle Hersteller auch Jets mit hochverdichteter Ausgestaltung für Billigfluglinien und regionale Flüge.
1892	Airbus offers a class A350, but according to its own report, it hasn't yet sold them.	Airbus is offering an A350 with ten seaters, but according to its own statement, no one still sells it.	Airbus sells a A350-T with ten seats, but according to their own statement, it hasn't sold any yet.	Airbus bietet einen A350 mit zehnsitzigen Reihen, hat aber laut eigener Aussage noch keinen verkauft.
1893	Airbus said that it'd be important to allow more seating in the cabins and to offer wide seats on some jets.	Airbus has argued recently that the need for more passenger-room space is important, and some jets have wide seats on the ground.	Airbus made up its mind a few minutes ago that the cabin was more comfortable and some jets offered wide seats to the aisle.	Bis vor kurzem hat Airbus betont, wie wichtig mehr Anpassbarkeit der Kabinen sei und für einige Jets breite Sitze an den Gängen angeboten.
1894	Even if the support of only other manufacturers of large modern jets is unlikely to be influenced; however from the well-known 787X-Very likely, a number of jets can be ordered by the customer.	Without the support of any other manufacturer of modern jets, experts say that reputation for a new standard might be fading, but from the well-known 777X-Very expensive units can't have shipped.	Without the support of any other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the reputation for a new standard may be reduced, but from the well-known Boeing 777X sales channel, the ability to deliver was likely to be deficient.	Ohne die Unterstützung des einzigen anderen Herstellers großer moderner Jets sagen Experten, dass der Ruf nach einem neuen Branchenstandard vermutlich verpuffen werde, aber von der Welle von 777X-Verkäufen ablenken könnte.
1895	The Vegan lexicon suggests the vegetarian movement is quite distinctive, but it distinguishes from this in a way.	The Vegan is essentially the opposite of Vegetarian in the Lexicon, but it really differs from this one.	The vegans, the Lexic on vegetarianism, differs very much from that of course.	Der Veganismus ist laut Lexika dem Vegetarismus unterstellt, unterscheidet sich von diesem aber doch auf ganz erhebliche Weise.
1896	While vegans eat the likeness of steamed vegetables, ice cubes or a strong anemone is not included on the vegan's menu.	When veg eaters who use sahne to dye their veg, eating ice or an arduous edifice can't put these meat and vegetables on the menu of vegans.	When vegetarians eat the likes of sahne, ice or an strong edmeria, these meat-crackers don't come on the menu of vegans.	Denn während Vegetarier sich den Verzehr von Sahnetorte, Eis oder einem kräftigen Edamer erlauben, stehen diese Schlemmereien nicht auf der Speisekarte eines Veganers.
1897	Using milk, cheese and egg as a side dish, vegans will not get any animal products except chicken.	All the milk, cheeses, eggs, apart from the fattening in meat and fish allows the vegan to eat all the tier-trade animals, not only the cow's skin.	Egg, milk, cheese and eggs prevent the vegan from eating all manner of animal products - also egg is incorporated.	Milch, Käse, Ei, neben den Verzicht auf Fleisch und Fisch lässt der Veganer vom sämtlichen Verzehr tierischer Produkte ab - auch Honig wird verneint.
1898	What remains to be wondered at, but a closer look at the vegan diet results in a more specific set of rules and regulations.	What remains, you may ask, but closer examination of the vegan diet reveals it through a logical and rational approach.	What remains of which to ask, but closer examination gives rise to an aesthetically appealing landscape of vegan food.	Was bleibt, mag man sich fragen, doch bei näherer Betrachtung zeichnet sich die vegane Ernährungswelt durch einen beachtlichen Einfallsreichtum aus.
1899	"""Boatcakes are very popular"", says Ute Hekelmann, the head of the historic Reform House that provides a variety of special products to vegans."	"""Creams are well-liked"", states Ute Hekelmann, the proprietor of the historic reform house which prepares a variety of special products for vegans."	"""Browns are very popular"", says Ute Hekelmann, the owner of the historic reform building which makes a variety of products for vegans."	"""Brotaufstriche sind sehr beliebt"", erklärt Ute Henkelmann, die Inhaberin des hiesigen Reformhauses, die eine Vielzahl spezieller Produkte für Veganer bereithält."
1900	As a matter of fact, Reuben Proctor is visiting the store in this street.	Auch Reuben Proctor likes to go to the shop in the front desk.	Even Reuben Proctor likes popping into the store at the counter.	Auch Reuben Proctor besucht den Laden in der Domgasse gerne.
1901	"The vegan who grew up in Rome, finds almost everything he needs to live. ""1997 gave me my diet and became a vegetarian""."	"Living vegan for 13 years, the adopted New Zealander has almost everything he needs to. ""I put myself on my diet in 1997 and became vegetarian."""	"Living vegan for 13 years, the mute Newcomer living in Lampertheim finds almost all he need to know. ""It became a vegetarian when I was a child and became vegetarian."""	"Seit 13 Jahren lebt der gebürtige Neuseeländer vegan, in Lampertheim findet er (fast) alles vor, was er zum Leben braucht. ""1997 stellte ich meine Ernährung um und wurde Vegetarier""."
1902	Toward the turn of century, the next step came in, becoming vegan.	At the turn of century twenty, the next step became Vegan.	The last step occurred at the millennium, when I became an vegan.	Um die Jahrhundertwende erfolgte dann der nächste Schritt und ich wurde Veganer.
1903	The shedding wasn't just because of the food but because of the shoe fittings, says Proctor, who is making the traditional style leather.	The problem was not just about food, but rather the shoe selection, says Proctor, who has brought down the standard pair of leathers.	The overheating occurred not only because of the food but also because of shoes, says Proctor, who is cutting normal leather.	"""Die Überzeugung kam aber nicht nur wegen der Ernährung, sondern aufgrund der Schuhwahl"", sagt Proctor, der Kunstleder normalem Leder vorzieht."
1904	He realized that all sorts of commerce is not without its products.	He realized that many everyday goods don't necessarily have to be treated with such products.	He realized that he couldn't carry on with everyday life without any such products.	Er erkannte, dass es auch in anderen alltäglichen Belangen ohne tierische Produkte geht.
1905	A vegan in first place is a vegan.	In the first place vegans are Ethik.	In most cases, vegans are just like eggs to eat.	In erster Linie ist vegan sein eine Ethik.
1906	"I do not want to die of animals that harm me,"" says Proctor the maxim of vegans who are resentful about entire consumer behaviour."	"""I don't want to have animals killed for me,"" says Proctor, the head of a vegan who is disgusting with the entire consumer behaviour."	"""I don't want to eat animals that I do not need"", says Proctor, maximising the vegan which is putting his betrayal on the whole of consumer behaviour."	"""Ich will nicht, dass Tiere für mich sterben müssen"", spricht Proctor die Maxime der Veganer aus, die sich auf das gesamte Konsumverhalten erstreckt."
1907	The smell of burgers, grits or bears is why vegans quickly found completely new products.	Using the tail of meat, flour or peanuts, the vegan quickly discovered totally new products. The trend towards it was soon apparent.	When it comes to putting raw or raw food behind, vegans quickly discovered completely new products and the trend of consumer acceptance quickly.	Statt Burgern, Rühreiern oder Gummibären hinterherzutrauern, habe der Veganer schnell ganz neue Produkte entdeckt, die Begeisterung stieg an.
1908	Proctor says this is a double bonus that, after all, not making up for lost vegan meat, is more likely to result in the substitution of options for a food preparation, putting Proctor on the back of the decision.	"It's a double bonus, says Proctor today: ""naturally, veganism is not an insinuation, there're no aspirations, rather it's a supplement"", Proctor's claim that the selection of food options is based on the fact that he's already making adjustments to the diet, leading him to the lapse of his right to eat before the end of the term 'food'."	"Proctor says ""it's a double bonus,"" adding: ""At the moment, veganism isn't just about eating, neither is savoury as it is, but rather an exercise which leads him closer to the decision on food options that will ultimately reduce the choice for later."	"""Es ist ein doppelter Bonus"", sagt Proctor heute, ""tatsächlich stellt vegan sein keinen Verzicht, keine Askese dar, sondern es ist eine Bereicherung"". Die Annahme, dass man mit der Ernährungsumstellung die Auswahl an Speiseoptionen reduziere, führt Proctor eher auf die Macht der Gewohnheit zurück."
1909	Just these conditions forced some people to try as hard as they tried.	In specific, those conditions allowed some otherwise well-meaning attempts.	And precisely these conditions also made some attempts as well.	Und genau diese Konditionierungen ließen auch manchen noch so gut gemeinten Versuch scheitern.
1910	The effect of search is a factor that has a significant impact, which may be compared with smoking.	"Proctor gives a comparison: ""Current factors are very decisive factors which many people decide to use, as does smoking."""	The factor of choice is quite an important factor that can be easily changed by many, similar to smoking, makes Proctor a comparative proposition.	"""Der Suchtfaktor ist ein ganz entscheidender Faktor, der viele schnell aufgeben lässt, ähnlich wie beim Rauchen"", stellt Proctor einen Vergleich auf."
1911	"And it's a new rule: ""The animals are not in the best of spirits""."	"And turn one: ""Most goats aren't tied to the animals""."	"And a remark makes, ""You've got to be careful not to touch animals."""	"Und wendet ein: ""Bestimmte Geschmäcker sind nicht am Tier festzumachen""."
1912	There are many recipes or the way to prepare the food that makes a person feel good.	There are often the ice cubes or the condiments which change the taste.	It is often the recipes or the manners of preparing that entice you to indulge in your taste.	Oft sind es die Gewürze oder die Art der Zubereitung, die den Geschmack ausmachen.
1913	You can also produce the same effect in other ways, the vegan explained.	One could have the same effect, explained the vegan.	You could achieve the same effect but without using other methods, as explained by the vegan.	"""Man kann aber auch auf andere Weise den gleichen Effekt erzeugen"", verdeutlicht der Veganer."
1914	Taking part in a BBQ adds some extra virgin olive oil, carrot juice, and a couple of vegan spices.	A barbecue brings some carrots, veg and a few vegetables.	A barbecue brings about roasted vegetables, mushrooms and a bit of vegan sausage.	Zu einem Grillfest bringt Proctor beispielsweise Auberginen, Champignons und auch ein paar Veganwürste mit.
1915	He focuses on an abundant, nutritious diet, that is sometimes recommended to include a healthy breakfast.	He considers eating an extremely high-quality diet, which should be tempered with caution.	He's looking for an adapted, healthy diet, and in many cases, he says that he should eat it at once.	Er achtet auf eine ausgewogene, abwechslungsreiche Ernährung, bei der es durchaus auch einmal deftig schmecken soll.
1916	Of course, you would like something between your teeth, but it would be legitimate.	Of course you'd like something between the teeth, but it is legitimate.	Of course you would like to have something between your teeth, but it's legitime.	Natürlich möchte man etwas zwischen den Zähnen haben, das ist legitim.
1917	"'It is supposed to snooze, but that's not just food. ""Proceeds are not meant for consumption"", says Proctor."	It is supposed to suck, but that's not just a matter to reduce, says Proctor.	"""It's meant to sooth, but it's not just about animal food,"" says Proctor."	"""Es soll schmecken, aber das ist nicht nur auf tierische Nahrung zu reduzieren"", so Proctor."
1918	The injuries to your health, including seizures, are not minor.	He has not been suffering from a serious injury, and he hasn't suffered from a further increase in the number of factors.	He hasn't suffered from serious health problems, nor have his actions prevented severe deterioration.	Gesundheitliche Schäden bis hin zu Essstörungen, eine weitere weitverbreitete Annahme, habe er nicht erlitten.
1919	The assessment was positive for me.	The outcome was positive for me.	The assessment was positive for me.	Für mich hatte die Umstellung einen positiven Aspekt.
1920	No foreign sugar is taken and my vitamin A is boosted.	I don't take any foreign cholesterol, and have a dose of vitamin D.	I don't have any foreign cholesterin and I have an increased vitamin D.	Ich nehme kein fremdes Cholesterin auf und habe einen erhöhten Vitaminanteil.
1921	There are athletes who do not eat vegan food.	There are highly performing athletes who only eat vegan meats.	There are many athletes who eat nothing except vegan foods.	Es gibt Hochleistungsathleten, die sich ausschließlich vegan ernähren.
1922	"His blood pressure is good enough, I often have a blood count,"" says Proctor."	His blood tests are good, I often have it checked, said the doctor.	His blood pressure is great, I often have my blood drawn, says Proctor.	"""Meine Blutwerte sind bestens, ich lasse mich oft checken"", verrät Proctor."
1923	In particular, vitamin B12 warns vegans and ketones.	Taking vitamins in particular warns a lot of vegans.	A lot of vegans believe in vitamin B12 especially before they are able to take vitamin B12.	Insbesondere vor dem Mangel an Vitamin B12 warnen viele Vegansimus-Kritiker.
1924	While some animals fed on animal fats, they are doubtful if the meat they buy is full of vitamin B12.	Traders say that when animals fed with butter will not grow, but in the meat which is eaten, vitamin B12 is high, says Proctor.	Whenever animals fed or eaten, it's questionable whether the meat bought in the fridge has a lot of vitamin B12-Acid content.	"""Da Tiere mit Futtermitteln genährt werden, statt auf der Weide zu grasen, ist es fraglich, ob in dem Fleisch, das man in der Kühltruhe kauft, der Vitamin-B12-Anteil hoch ist"", findet Proctor."
1925	Vegans may take the coenzyme in form of tablets.	For vegetarians, this supplement will give the option to take the vitamin in form of tablets.	Vegans may take the supplement by taking tablets.	Für Veganer gebe es zudem die Möglichkeit, das Coenzym in Form von Tabletten zu sich zu nehmen.
1926	He's saying that his B12 gloves are in order.	"""My B12 seeds are in order,"" says he."	His B12 words are right, he says.	"""Meine B12-Werte sind in Ordnung"", erklärt er."
1927	There can't be a substitute for the purchase of food.	To avoid dry roads, you shouldn't go to the store for food.	We need to avoid roads that are unsafe for food.	Weite Wege müsse Proctor für die Nahrungsmittelbeschaffung nicht gehen.
1928	There's a whole host of food products everywhere and virtually each supermarket now has soy and other products.	There is some basic ingredients everywhere, and every supermarket has now juicier and other products.	There are literally everywhere and every supermarket has products like soy milk and other.	Grundnahrungsmittel gibt es schließlich überall und jeder Supermarkt hat mittlerweile Sojamilch und andere Produkte.
1929	All that I need is to find something.	Everything I need is located right here.	All I need is somewhere.	Alles, was ich brauche, finde ich vor Ort.
1930	Only after I have purchased something spicy will I buy it.	Only after buying some spices will I buy more and more.	Only after I've bought a few vegetables.	Nur ab und an kaufe ich etwas Spezielles.
1931	"Occasionally people will see that only fermenting products are expensive, but this is also true of ferments that ""can't be used for fermenting"", as well."	"Very few people notice that they only buy fertiliser, but this is how it goes with ""normal fertilizer"", as well."	"Some people assume just fertilizers are expensive, but that's the way it is with ""normal"" fertilizer products, as well."	"""Viele Leute übersehen, dass eben nur die Fertigprodukte teuer sind, aber so verhält es sich bei ""gewöhnlichen"" Fertigprodukten bekanntermaßen auch""."
1932	Vegan cooking is much cheaper and shorter to make than it should be.	Without vegan recipes, they're far less expensive and time-consuming than regular ones.	Without that, preparation vegan meals are much cheaper and less time-consuming than preparation traditional ones.	Ohnehin sei die Zubereitung veganer Gerichte weitaus günstiger und weniger zeitaufwendig, als gemeinhin angenommen.
1933	"""In the kitchen there are a lot of things that one can discover with a few small knives, though not to achieve any better results,"" says Proctor."	"There is a lot for discover in the dorm; using small knives, on the other hand, one can get good results but not much better,"" said Proctor."	There's a lot of things that can be discovered in the kitchen, so you can get good results, though not at once.	"""In der Hausküche gibt es viel zu entdecken, mit ein paar kleinen Kniffen kann man gute, wenn nicht teilweise bessere Ergebnisse erzielen"", sagt Proctor."
1934	Margarine instead of butter, a bit more back and forth flour and nutmeg substituted egg, as well as his vegan cheesecake could bring up his bacon and turn it into tusks.	Using margarine instead of butter, a bit more nutmeg and coke may have steamed up his vegan cheesecake.	Margarine instead of butter, a little more acidity and carbon dioxide than edamame, with his vegan cheesecake Proctor was able to turn his nut allergies into flour, and he was also able to turn his sprouting onions into tea.	Margarine statt Butter, etwas mehr Backpulver und Kohlensäure statt Ei, mit seinen veganen Käsekuchen konnte Proctor auch seine Schwiegereltern zum Staunen bringen.
1935	Veggies get a new wave of vegans.	A new breed of vegans is welcomed.	The Vegan is affording a new taste.	Familienfesten verleiht der Veganer eine neue Würze.
1936	There's a reason that people cook together gives it a new meaning.	It's got a new significance when people cook together.	This is a new idea when we cook together.	Das hat Dynamik, wenn man zusammen kocht, hat das einen neuen Stellenwert.
1937	"""The situations that can arise through this are as varied as individuals themselves,"" says Proctor."	These situations that can arise are as different than the ones oneself, says Proctor.	The situations that can arise from this are quite different from those people themselves, says Proctor.	"""Die Situationen, die dabei entstehen können, sind so unterschiedlich wie die Menschen selbst"", sagt Proctor."
1938	Of course, he was well taken care of but also septicaemia.	Of course, he was stung with a scl.	He was obviously treated for scurvy but, in fact, he was also treated for scurvi.	Natürlich wurde ihm aber auch schon Skepsis entgegengebracht.
1939	Don't you want to eat my food anymore?	Doesn't your food taste good?	Doesn't your stomach eat my food anymore?	Schmeckt dir mein Essen nicht mehr?
1940	Why am I feeling bad, because I'm drinking milk? - in such cases, vegans have to take some time to think.	"Do you need to feel bad now, after drinking milk?"" ""Does vegans with fingertip feeling have to do so."""	"Do you feel bad if I drink milk? ""You need to take your hat off in those sort of questions,"" Vegans should have fingertips."	"""Soll ich mich jetzt schlecht fühlen, weil ich Milch trinke?"" - bei solcherlei Fragen müsse man als Veganer mit Fingerspitzengefühl agieren."
1941	No longer do I tolerate people, I'm part of this business, and no one wants to be in the nick.	I don't let people down, as I am part of that company, so I don't want to be sued.	I don't tolerate people, I'm part of this company. Proctor doesn't want to be the one who's making the rules.	"""Ich lehne die Menschen ja nicht ab, ich bin Teil dieser Gesellschaft"", möchte Proctor kein Enklavendasein fristen."
1942	And more precisely, the way we live isn't very vegan as you might think – and vegans are not limited to the same activities as they would assume.	And more closely examining, the everyday world does not look so vegan as you think. and the practical vegan is not allowed to be restricted in the way that we think it is, and the Veganer is not considered to be in fact a minority.	Moreover, more closely, the everyday environment doesn't appear as vegan as you might think.

Of course, it is likely that people are going to smoke him out so as not he can quit smoking.	Wahrscheinlicher aber ist, dass Raucher ihn einsetzen würden, um aufzuhören.
1987	"Then you know: once they begin to smoke, they don't feel guilty anymore because of the nicotine inhalation and that helps them put off smoking as well"", he says."	They also know they do not remember putting on weight, so that they don't feel like smoking anymore, he explains.	They know then: As they set about smoking again, they don't feel like smoking because of the nicotine atomizer, and this helps them to switch to a different habit, he explains.

You could easily throw away a few tipped to the road instead of hitting the pavement where no one want to tread on the other side of the pond.	Da würden ein paar Tüten mehr oder weniger doch auch nix ausmachen - im Gegensatz zur Straße, wo keiner auf den Essensresten anderer rumtrampeln will.

The presence of some young people who are still missing from the enumeration of the city's main and town council papers shows that when you read the circulars on the post office counter, it quickly becomes clear that the issue of voting on Sundays and holiday days is not an issue anymore, which, as a result, the FDP is announcing.	"""Viele Bürger werden es noch nicht gemerkt haben, die roten Punkte für die Sonntagsleerung befinden sich noch an verschiedenen Briefkästen der Kernstadt und den Stadtteilen, aber liest man das Kleingedruckte an den gelben Behältern der Post AG, findet man schnell heraus, dass die Leerung an Sonn- und Feiertagen nicht mehr stattfindet"", teilt die FDP mit."

2878	"There's been claimed that in ""double down"", arguing that the bench had judged the merits of bidding for their ""equal and personal relationships, finally it was decided upon seeing as the evidence showed that the candidate's presidential chances did not necessarily improve."

2882	"Despite the designation ""the syllable of choice"", Martin told Anderson Cooper in The Guardian that he had been a lot of work in the effort to secure the return of election, trying to figure out whether a train was likely to appear in front of the polling stations before Election Day."

"As the investigation was described as a ""proven electoral fraud"", Martin told Anderson Cooper in an interview that he had been involved in the campaign to win back the election for finding whether such a train sat in front of the polling booth at the time it was announced."

2897	To be commended were the contribution of the community sector to the VAT and the income tax.	To make up for the increase in taxable income and the local tax cut, the council approved a bill to be higher.	To be grateful, the excesses and the town-wide cap on the income tax have increased.	Zu verdanken sei der Überschuss vor allem höheren Gewerbesteuereinnahmen und dem Gemeindeanteil an der Einkommenssteuer.

2901	As budgetary measures have been reduced to the bare minimum, the return on investment is even higher.	Having received less investment in the budget year 2012 than planned, the number of cases to be heard has also fallen.	Since there were fewer investments than planned in the budget year 2012, the number of appeals made was also higher.	Da im Haushaltsjahr 2012 weniger Investitionen als geplant getätigt worden sind, ist auch die Rücklagenzuführung höher ausgefallen.

I know the vast and varied things that Obama achieved: from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal from the Iraq war; the end of the enactment of a ban on homosexuality in the Armed Forces; and the killing of Osama.	I recognise the great and diverse things Obama achieved from the signing of the Affordable Care Act for health care to the withdrawal from the conflict in Iraq, the end of the escalating debates over sexuality and the killing of President Osama.

2938	Also, I think that there's been too many restrictions on the political and financial policy which our country should pursue: amendments, a public option for health insurance and the ban on Guantanamo Bay just to name three.

2941	The republican blockade cannot be explained why it is illegal to abhor foreign federations or to kill innocent children by dripping.	The republican blockade can't explain why foreign nationals are being abducted, or the detention of innocent children by poisoning cannot be explained.	A ban on republikan citizens is inscrutable, which can cause the abhorrent behaviour of foreign nationals or the killing innocent children through kidnapping.	Die republikanische Blockadepolitik kann nicht erklären, weshalb man das Abhören ausländischer Staatsoberhäupter zulässt oder die Tötung unschuldiger Kinder durch Drohnen in Übersee.
2942	It cannot be explained why the National Security Agency collects personal data on Americans, or why whistleblowers are encouraged to expose government behavior.

2943	It can't explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor what public spending and expenditure limits were set during the Presidential elections.	It is impossible to explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-american citizens, was murdered without the need for prosecution, or when the public funding and access limits will be extended during the presidential election.	Why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was murdered without the murdering process, or why the public expenditure and expenditure limit during the presidential election are extended to the president's elections.	Es kann nicht erklären, weshalb Anwar al-Awlaki, ein US-amerikanischer Staatsbürger, ohne Verfahren ermordet wurde, noch weshalb die öffentlichen Finanzierungs- und Ausgabegrenzen während der Präsidentschaftswahlen umgangen werden.
2944	"It is not enough for a report to conclude in which the measures taken by the White House to promote the media are the ""most aggressive... since Nixon was created""."	"It is not fair to the results of a report, in which it is noted that the measures taken by White Houses to regulate media are the ""most violent... since Nixon's administration""."	The results in a report on the subject of how the White House's efforts to reform the media are not the most aggressive since Nixon's administration.

2945	In the past three years since the Affordable Care Act was acted upon, it is not an excuse for having created a simple website.	And little can it be excused that more than three years since the repeal of the Affordable Care Act incorporated simply another website.	Moreover, it doesn't excuse the fact that more than three years since the repeal of Affordable Care Act made an easy website accessible.	Und jüngstens kann es nicht die Unfähigkeit entschuldigen, in den mehr als drei Jahren seit der Verabschiedung des Affordable Care Act eine einfache Website zu entwerfen.

2947	It should've been understood that the government working on her proposals for political campaigns could be discussed more widely.

Whether I were aged 18, I should have understood that the government working on her political campaigns could be wider.	Ob ich mit 18 hätte verstehen sollen, dass die Regierungsarbeit den ihr vorangehenden politischen Kampagnen widersprechen könnte.
2948	Obviously, the orderly course is not permanent, since an opposition party or event like Newtown Massacre may preoccupy the public debate.	Organizational issues do not fall premeditated, as an opposition party and unusual event such as the Boston Marathon set off public debate.	Moreover, the abort is not predictable, considering an Opposition event and events such as the Newtown massacre are likely to trigger public debate.	Offensichtlich ist das Abgeordnetenamt kein vorhersehbarer Kurs, da eine Oppositionspartei und zufällige Ereignisse wie das Newtown-Massaker die öffentliche Diskussion prägen.
2949	When I look at these examples above, they appear to be taken far from the government itself.	Even if I look at the above-mentioned examples, they seem to be elected by the government itself.	However, if I look at the above-mentioned examples, they seem to be far removed from what the government says.	Doch wenn ich mir die oben genannten Beispiele ansehe, dann scheinen sie weitgehend von der Regierung selbst gewählt zu sein.

Ich hatte den Eindruck, eine zweite Amtszeit für Obama, frei vom Druck künftiger Wahlen, würde die Hoffnung erfüllen, von der wir schon so lange gehört hatten.
2954	But with the vote-topping decline for Obama by less than 45% this week, the return of that book to 2008 has become so much more exciting.	But the drop in voter turnout for Obama dropped below 45 % this week, the return to this book was so dramatic that even though it was written back in 2008; it made no sense.	Nevertheless, the voter turnout for Obama fell below 45 % this week, and the return of this book has become so much worse.	Doch mit dem Sinken der Zustimmungswerte für Obama auf unter 45 % diese Woche ist die Rückkehr ins Jahr 2008 durch dieses Buch um so härter geworden.
2955	The sight of the many promises thrown in me is creeping up with me.	The smell of the many promises that have popped up in me aches after being resolved.
