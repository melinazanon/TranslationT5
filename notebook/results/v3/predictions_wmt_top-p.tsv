To accomplish this, we asked the largest and most rambling question under British bosses who asked what they thought about the UK, the economy and EU.

It's a lot of things: a change in the agreement to leave and better conditions for large Britain would lead to a majority changes to the EU opinion before long.

210	The benefit was many: Participants would not be without work, the companies would seek specialists who are always lacking in hotels and guesthouses, and agents wouldn't need to finance unemployment.	The benefits were numerous: Participants would not be without a job, companies would not recruit specialists who are often absent from hotels and guest places, and agents would not be in the same position to finance unemployment.	The benefits were numerous: the participants wouldn't be without work, the companies employed specialists who are always fewer in hotels and resorts, and agents cannot afford to create jobs.	Der Nutzen sei vielfältig: Die Teilnehmer würden dadurch nicht arbeitslos, die Firmen bekämen geschulte Fachkräfte, die immer stärker in Hotels und Gaststätten fehlten, und die Agentur müsse nicht Arbeitslosigkeit finanzieren.

"Professor Vallorenti said: ""We showed the dogs' films with dogs either a natural version or a silhouette, to remove distracting aspects, and we could control the movements of the wings more toward left or right."""	Professor Valloretto said that we have shown the dog's movies with dogs either as a natural version or a silhouette, which removes obvious differences and allowed us to control the movements of the wings more toward left and right.

987	When the animals looked as if an unusually unlucky dog the move towards the right was totally relaxed from the perspective of the wedlock dogs.	When the animals acted like an ordinary dog, the movement towards the right was completely relaxed.	When the animals were observing how an otherwise insufferable dog moved up the downward spiral (via the perspective of the other dogs), they remained completely relaxed.	Wenn die Tiere sahen, wie ein ansonsten ausdrucksloser Hund den Schwanz nach rechts bewegt hat (von der Perspektive des wedelnden Hundes aus gesehen), blieben sie völlig entspannt.
988	But the tendency to bite downward was slowly turning (standing in view of the dogs, who were also weeping), so rose her heart and they looked out in disgust.	But the tendency to leave slowly, and being compared with the dog peasant, raised her heart rate and seemed uneasy.	But the tendency to pull links, which was a reflection of the dog who was holding its tail, increased her heart rate and she looked nonchalant.	War aber die Schwanzneigung vornehmlich nach links (wieder aus Perspektive des Hundes, der wedelt), so stieg ihre Herzfrequenz und sie sahen unruhig aus.

991	When the tendency to behave more affectionately with others is been done in a way that is more friendly and the right side later exhibited less kindness, then one responds on basis of those experiences.	When there are different arrangements with other dogs and the behavior of the leash in a direction that favours kindness and the right side is likely to favor something less kind, then it will be decided on the basis of those experiences.	When you experiment with other dogs and the dog's behaviour subsequently becomes more kind, and the right side of the same behave produces less friendly behaviour.

995	Several students at the University of Victoria in Canada stand to benefit from becoming more and more involved in robotics when their ‘links’ are twisted and not straight, making them more dangerous, specifically than they do in the Italian university.	"An earlier research project at the University of Victoria, Canada stood as follows: ""Billions of people can rely on robots when their ‘brakes' are bent and not straight, making it even more dangerous than in the Italian studies."""	In another research project at the University of Victoria in Canada, they say that many have gone robotically if their 'properties' were wet and not straight – very different from that of the Italian college.	"In einer anderen Forschungsarbeit an der Universität von Victoria in Kanada stand Folgendes: „Hunde gehen eher auf einen Roboterhund zu, wenn sein ,Schwanz‘ links wedelt und nicht rechts, statt unruhig zu werden – genau andersherum als in der italienischen Studie."""
996	According to his statement, the difference between the animals in the different studies that are interpreted as being dogs and robots is not significant.	Despite his assertion, the difference between the different studies' animals in the films and the robots isn't necessarily the same thing.	The point of his statement could be the difference between the different studies the animals portrayed in the films and the robots portrayed as dogs.	Laut seiner Aussage könnten die Unterschiede daher rühren, dass die Hunde in den verschiedenen Studien die Tiere in den Filmen bzw. die Roboterhunde nicht als Hunde interpretierten.
997	He explained that he would be able to assist with a study like those in real life.	A study about how dogs react to real dogs could help, explained he.	A study on how dogs react to real dogs could help, explained he.	Eine Studie, wie Hunde auf echte Hunde reagieren, könnte helfen, erklärte er.
998	While there are many different kinds of organisms that both the brain and the brain are used for various purposes, most details have to be prepared - and dogs are no exception, says Bradshaw.	Whilst there are plenty of invertebrates that require both brain segments to be used for different purposes, much of the details need to be made clear – and dogs don't count as exceptions.	Although there are many kinds of agro-nuclear creatures that need to be used both brain parts for various purposes, many details do have to be added, but dogs are not the only exception.	"„Zwar gibt es beträchtliche Belege für viele verschiedene Säugetiere, dass die beiden Gehirnhälften für verschiedene Zwecke verwendet werden, doch müssen viele der Details noch bestimmt werden – und Hunde bilden da keine Ausnahme"", so Bradshaw."
999	Because of her behavior that doesn't necessarily lead to long, it won't take much time before we understand why this tendencies sometimes move in one direction or other.	Since your behavior is simply astute, it doesn't take long before we understand why the swing varies in one direction, and sometimes in another direction.	As your behavior is so simple, it won't take long to get understand why the swing in one direction sometimes heads off towards the other.	Da sich ihr Verhalten aber einfach aufzeichnen lasse, werde es vermutlich nicht lange dauern, bis wir verstehen, weshalb sich der Schwanz manchmal in die eine, manchmal in die andere Richtung bewegt.

1142	The old man just needs his storage space, so on.	You just have to find your backseat; this is how it's supposed to be.	One simply needs his backroom to take its place in the age of retirement. That's how you make money.	'Im Alter braucht man einfach auch seine Rückzugsräume', so Ries.
1143	By having a single gulag that cannot be operated, the bookkeeper won't have to.	To operate a senior-oriented society can't necessarily lead to an independent author.

1153	Even in the flat where they live are allowed to realise one or another, and only if it's the toilet curtain that matters, the interior architects will find relief.	Certainly in a rental flat one can realise it, and when there's only the toilet fitting upstairs clarifies the interior.	Even in the flat where there is no one can do this, or only the toilet curtain will be fixed, the interior architekton minds get involved.	Selbst in der Mietwohnung lasse sich das eine oder andere realisieren, und wenn es nur die Toilettensitzerhöhung ist, klärt die Innenarchitektin auf.
1154	But even if it's still so beautiful, it doesn't always make any sense to transform the apartment into something different and barrier-free.

Whilst it might be possible to install a riser in the flat, it would also be much larger if it were not foreseen up the steps to the bathroom door, but that'd certainly be far greater if it were not.	Whilst it could be installed inside the flat a treppen elevator would also be feasible, it'd be much larger if you could walk up to the door.	Zwar könnte man innerhalb der Wohnung einen Treppenlift installieren, der ebenfalls mit Treppen gepflasterte Weg bis an die Wohnungstür wäre aber das weitaus größere Hindernis.

She's going to look for the perfect object for herself and her husband.	Sie wird weitersuchen, bis sie das ideale Objekt für sich und ihren Mann gefunden hat.
1158	She grates more before her move than before her eviction.	She grumbles more before she gets ready for the move than before she leaves her apartment door.	She groaned a bit before the move.	Vor dem Umzug graut es ihr mehr als vor der Spinne an ihrer Wohnungstür.

1210	The fragile relation is not just a thief's relationship, but a thief's one who ties his lawyer to it.	The fragile relationship is not just a relation between a drug dealer and a drug dealer who combines his lawyer with him.	The fragile relation isn't simply the one of a drug dealer's agents, but a drug dealer who worries about his lawyer.	Die fragliche Beziehung ist nicht einfach die eines Drogenhändlers, sondern eines Drogenhändlers, der seinen Anwalt mit Drogen versorgt.
1211	A part of his messages were never legitimized; he was the attorney for that person.	He was not the lawyer for part of his assignments, but he was the attorney for one of them.

1217	But after hearing the call from the police in Lancashire, Deputy Inspector-General Gary Ditta made the step to an organized crime laboratory when he began to acquire the necessary tools to conduct searches for organised crime.

"Doch nach der Anhörung sagte Superintendent Lee Halstead von der Polizei in Lancashire: „Herr Ditta hat den Schritt von einem Strafverteidiger zu einem Kriminellen in dem Moment getan, als er anfing, Drogen von organisierten Kriminellen zu erwerben."""
1218	His addiction to cocaine led to a hoffnungslose complicity and he often sought after by the organizer of organized crime who asked him to collect useful information on police activities.	His driving habit led to a hoovering complicity, and he was encouraged by the organizers of the organized crime organization who worked with him to obtain valuable information on criminal justice.	His codependency led to a holose compromise and made him reluctant for the motives of the organised criminal activity that he was charged with gathering valuable information on police investigations.	Seine Kokainabhängigkeit führte zu einer hoffnungslosen Kompromittierung und machte ihn empfänglich für die Motive führender Mitglieder der organisierten Kriminalität, die ihn beauftragten, wertvolle Informationen über polizeiliche Ermittlungen einzuholen.

Dattata has put her trust behind this and is trying to hide behind the facade of his job.	Ditta hat dieses Vertrauen hintergangen und versucht, sich hinter der Fassade seines Berufs zu verschanzen.
1221	The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire conducted the trials against Tatta, which also led to a conviction for possession of cocaine and grounds for refusing to use it, something we had intended to do in three cases when our authority was to bring criminal charges.	The Serious Crime Unit in Lancashire led the charge against Typhoons, which lead to a conviction in three cases for possession of drugs and justification for our decision to bring criminal matters before court.	The Serious Crime and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Tata, to be sanctioned in three cases against Kokain and justification for our decision to bring crimes before a court, which is not the consent of our authority.	Die Serious and Organised Crime Unit von Lancashire leitete die Ermittlungen gegen Ditta, die auch zu einer Verurteilung in drei Fällen wegen des Besitzes von Kokain und Justizbehinderung führten, was unsere Entschlossenheit unterstreicht, Kriminelle vor Gericht zu bringen.
1222	A mental health warning should be given in this case, showing that nobody can take the arm of the law.	In this case, murder should be a warning and shows that no one can take advantage of the law.	Criminals should be warned, and demonstrate that no one can enact the law.	Dieser Fall sollte Kriminellen eine Warnung sein und zeigt, dass sich keiner dem Arm des Gesetzes entziehen kann.

1226	In a section of his website, there was an answer to questions and answers about his dream job as a lawyer in the United States, where he announced that his last guest was Mohammed Ali and hence, his potential employer's motivation was Chancenunity.	On his website he put a section with questions and answers on why he had decided to represent his dream job in the U.S.A., saying that while eating dinner he invited an invitation to Malik Ali and the prospect of her employment as a guest was the motivation for which he turned out.

1227	At least once a week, the police patrol may take place in a quiet town like Halloween.	A calm night for the police could be back by at least one-and-a-half.

Die Beamten wurden lediglich zweimal zu eierwerfenden Kindern gerufen, welche diese gegen Hausfassaden warfen.
1229	It doesn't seem like the culprits happened properly, and the culprits did not do it immediately, so it wouldn't have caused a problem.	If the culprits for this occurred promptly and the culprits soon disappeared, then they probably wouldn't have caused a loss of revenue.	When the homeowners were correctly recognized and the renters at once, there may not have been any accidents.	Da die Hauseigentümer dies rechtzeitig erkannten und die Eierreste gleich entfernten, dürfte auch kein Sachschaden entstanden sein.
1230	It is probably because there were a few storms in the city area that some people climbed, but there's no harm here either.	There are surely some deftly populated areas, but there's no such damage either.	As to some of the other buildings in town, some barfing was done, but there was no harm done here either.

"Should the underground bridge ""Its a good idea to make it safer?"	"Soll der Bahnübergang ""Am Hirschen"" aufwändig umgebaut werden, um die Verkehrssicherheit zu erhöhen?"
1246	Yes, the council decided.	Yes, the council has voted for the community.	Yes, the council members have decided.	Ja, haben die Gemeinderäte beschlossen.
1247	Chutch has to take 220 000 Euro in the hand.	Strictly speaking, a wheeler must take 220 000 euros.	The hard-earned cash should be put towards a payment of 220 000 euro.	Schiltach muss dafür 220 000 Euro in die Hand nehmen.

1249	It's particularly advisable to increase the safety on trains. It happens frequently to collisions with other vehicles across the country.	Particular attention should be paid to the more serious issues involving crosswalks, as crash-related collisions with other vehicles frequently occur nationwide.	In particular, the safety on trains should be increased. It is frequently frowned upon collisions with other cars nationwide.	Besonders soll dabei die Sicherheit an Bahnübergängen erhöht werden - regelmäßig kommt es bundesweit zu Kollisionen von Zügen mit anderen Fahrzeuge.
1250	If they want to authorize the Umbau, they have to contribute a third of the costs, while the rest will be shared with others.

1251	"Towards the end of the 1930s, town councilman Roland Grießhaber explained to the communityrate the specialities of the ""caveyard"" ""forecourt""."	"Hitherto, city planner Roland Grouthaber explained to the town council the particulars of the ""green migration"" between the stags."	"Urban planner Roland Grießhaber explained to the town council the particulars of the drainage crossing ""Herbarians""."	"Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Grießhaber erläuterte dem Gemeinderat die Besonderheiten des Bahübergangs ""Am Hirschen""."
1252	There are plans to build the town, in the height of the tunnel northwards from the station entrance, a branch extension.	There is a plan to build the town, in the amount of the tunnel north east of the station road junction, an extension to the former railway station.	There were plans to build the town on the outskirts of the tunnelway west of the depot.	Dort plant die Stadt, in Höhe des dortigen Tunnelmundes westlich der Bahngleise eine Ausbuchtung zu bauen.
1253	You could also place larger vehicles such as those transporting long-life wood, if you don't have to block the roads.	There could be larger vehicles, such as those carrying the log cabin, in traffic without having to block the road.	There could be larger vehicles, such as the utes transporting the pallets, while it is not necessary to block the corridor.	Dort könnten auch größere Fahrzeuge, zum Beispiel solche, die Langholz transportieren, bei Gegenverkehr stehen, ohne die Gleise blockieren zu müssen.
1254	By design, potters are pushing back a necessary wall so that the city can widen the road to allow for a dangerous traffic jam.	The pavement builders beg to install a necessary gutter so that the city can extend the following road in order to ensure there is no maintenance work to do as it would normally take.	Roadside sociologist recommends designing a necessary bridge to give sufficient time for the city to cross the street to permit it to ensure a reliable traffic flow.	Grießhaber schlug daher vor, eine erforderliche Stützmauer so zu konstruieren, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße zu gegebener Zeit verbreitern könne, um einen reibungslosen Verkehrsfluss zu gewährleisten.
1255	"The town council debated this when some terms that are like an accidents pose a question: how about taking so little money in order to avoid traffic jams? Thomas Kipp brought up the objection of the complainant, on the subject of his supposition, saying: ""Why shouldn't we take as much money in case of traffic jam?"""	The matter was debated in the town council, where some restrictions raised the doubt of the validity of a traffic ticket: John Kipp put his objection into question: Should we take that little money because there are so few cars?	"The discussion was heated in the community council, where some claims to the significance of traffic accidents were doubtful: Tom Kipp made up his objection on the point: ""How can we carry so much money into the community if there's not enough vehicles?"""	"Dies wurde im Gemeinderat kontrovers diskutiert, da einige Räte die Notwendigkeit einer Straßenverbreitung in Zweifel zogen: Thomas Kipp brachte mit seiner Äußerung die Stimmung der Kritiker auf den Punkt: ""Müssen wir wegen so wenigen Fahrzeugen so viel Geld in die Hand nehmen?"""
1256	"Tom Haas said that the ""ports"" are frequently used for long-haul transport."	"The Mayor, Thomas Haas, said that the ""way to Jerusalem"" is often used for languishing."	Mayor Tom Haas said that the railway station is often used for transporting lard.	"Bürgermeister Thomas Haas widersprach: Der Bahnübergang ""Hirschen"" werde regelmäßig für Langholztransporte genutzt."
1257	Even lumber from the area of Kuhbach will be transported along this line, because the ten metres long vehicles that have been stopping at the harbour bridge aren't allowed to use it because they cannot enter Port Victoria.	"Although the area ""Kuhbach"" is not being transported, the small number of vehicles on the track could not be used because they could not exit through the capital ring, going down to 20 metres."	"Even wood from the area of ""Cushka"" will be transported across this stretch because the up to 20 meter long vehicles couldn't use it as they would enter the main street."	"Selbst Holz aus dem Bereich ""Kuhbach"" werde teilweise über diese Strecke transportiert, weil die bis zu 20 Meter langen Fahrzeuge die Strecke an der Häberlesbrücke nicht nutzen könnten, weil sie dort nicht in die Hauptstraße abbiegen könnten."
1258	The stretch, used as a route to the vehicles that can't use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, argumentated Haas.	Further out, the track serves as a route for those vehicles not allowed to use the tunnel when it's busy.	The stretch further extends as a line to the vehicles that aren't permitted to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, argument continued.	Darüber hinaus diene die Strecke als Umleitungfür diejenigen Fahrzeuge, die den Tunnel nicht benutzen dürfen, wenn die Hauptstraße gesperrt ist, argumentierte Haas.
1259	"Though it is surreptitiously to construct and maintain Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels as this situation in Wolfsburg may, it can be used for a longer period to become a significant traffic jam, or even the crossing ""around""."	Because it's unclear to build and maintain Kirchberg- and Schlossberg tunnels, as this is currently in Wolfsburg, the railway station can easily serve as a tram stop for an extended period of time.	"The fact that Kirchberg- and Schlossberg construction and preservation of heritage as such as what the case is, could help to prolong the dangerous crossing ""on the route"" a critical traffic signal, and the possibility of being exposed for longer."	"Da abzusehen sei, dass Kirchberg- und Schlossbergtunnel umgebaut und saniert werden müssten, wie dies derzeit in Wolfach der Fall ist, könne dem Bahnübergang ""Am ""Hirschen"" auch für einen längeren Zeitraum eine wichtige Verkehrsbedeutung zukommen."
1260	The argument went on to how to ask how much the planned paving of the street would cost.	The problems spanned the band to decide how much the planned widening of the street would cost.	The rats came round to ask what would happen to the sloping pavement.	Die Räte kamen überein, untersuchen zu lassen, welche Kosten die angedachte Verbreiterung der Straße verursachen würde.
1261	"Not mentioning this, the alignment of the tramway was increased in such a way that the pavements further down to ""stationary"" should be erected so as to make city crosswalk accessible for pedestrians only by about five meters."	Not being taken into account the extension of the tramway in this sentence, the council has decided to make the necessary steps necessary so as to accommodate the city's pedestrian route running around 5,5 mn.	"Having in mind the construction of the underground platform was carried out more rigorously with the purpose that the necessary ramps are constructed so as to make city ""tourist's""-walk driveway accessible only by about five meter for oncoming traffic."	"Ungeachtet dessen wurde dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs mehrheitlich zugestimmt mit der Maßgabe, dass die erforderliche Stützmauer so gebaut wird, dass die Stadt die anschließende Straße Richtung ""Bahnhofstraße"" gegebenenfalls für Begegnungsverkehr auf rund 5,5 Meter ausbauen könne."
1262	"The extension of the train tunnel at the rail station could pose a whole other problem, as the ""gateway to Crocodile Road"" is steeply climbing."	"The scheme of the train interchanges at the Station could constitute a whole other problem as well, as the ""gateway"" is steeply climbs."	The Crossroads extension to the heritage museum might pose a whole other problem, as the route uphill to the famous gatefold.	"Der Umbau des Bahnübergangs bei der Gerberei Trautwein könnte dagegen ein ganz anderes Problem nach sich ziehen, das die Zufahrt in den stark ansteigenden ""Geroltzhäuser Weg"" betrifft."
1263	The management of the railway project were ordered by the engineer's office in order to doubt if the planned line up the Roltzhaus route was then possible even without another extension.	The management had sought the plan of the extension to the cellars but didn't think that it would be possible to carry on without any further investigation.	The engineer's office was looking through the plans for the extension of the line to the underground storage space, considering that she doubted whether the planned connection with the factory would be possible then without any further action.	Die Verwaltung hatte die Umbaupläne der Bahn vom Ingenieurbüro Breinlinger untersuchen lassen, da sie Zweifel daran hatte, ob der geplante Anschluss des Geroltzhäuser Wegs dann noch ohne weiteres möglich sei.
1264	The study concluded that it was not possible to conclude that the road conditions might cause longer cars to stoop.	The investigation concluded that it was not feasible to conclude that the traffic conditions in the road may lead to longer periods of driving.	The inquiry came to the conclusion that it was insinuating that the traffic conditions would lead to longer vehicles being parked.	Die Untersuchung kam zu dem Ergebnis, dass nicht auszuschließen sei, dass die Neigungsverhältnisse der Straße dazu führen könnten, dass längere Fahrzeuge aufsitzen.
1265	The responsibility here lies back to the town as a traffic accident reconstructionist.	The responsibility herein lies again with the city as the pavementspencer.	The responsibility here goes to the city as a traffic light.	Die Verantwortung hierfür trage wiederum die Stadt als Straßenbaulastträgerin.
1266	The build can become an liability dispute.	The undertaking may arise after the repair.	The building may not have the effect of liability on the contrary.	Der Umbau könne demnach Haftungsstreitigkeiten nach sich ziehen.
1267	As both the boards and the tracks were functioning properly, the construction of the bridge would have to be halted, argue Haas.	Since both the entrance and the exit to the station are working, it should not be necessary to approve the extension of the corridor, argumentated Haas.	While both the beams and the beams worked correctly, it was not intended to be approved for the reconstruction of the underground track.	Da sowohl die Holzabfuhr als auch das Abbiegen im aktuellen Ausbauzustand funktionierten, solle man dem Umbau des Bahnübergangs nicht zustimmen, argumentierte Haas.
1268	That risk of colliding with another vehicle on the way to here is significantly lower than that of other cars as it's just opposite the central station, which is very good for driving.	It is even less likely to collide with a vehicle approaching the interchange, being that it's just nearer the junction and certainly on better terms.	The risk of a collision with a vehicle in the overpass is much lower at this place, as it's just below the main stop point, where there's a good view.	Auch sei an dieser Stelle das Risiko einer Kollision des Zuges mit einem auf dem Übergang stehenden Fahrzeug deutlich geringer als an den anderen Bahnübergängen, weil sich direkt daneben der Haltepunkt Mitte befinde, zu dem eine gute Sichtverbindung bestehe.
1269	Even to this side of the central station should be enough to make sure that there isn't a knock.	Even a small section from the main square must already be prepared for an emergency.	Even a few steps from the Hauptbahnhof must already be enough to ensure that there's no chance of a collision.	Selbst Züge vom Hauptbahnhof her müssten an dieser Stelle schon soweit abgebremst sein, dass keine Kollision drohe.
1270	The majority of the proposed alterations were carried out because the city had to deal with the problem of on-site vehicles, so the road cause became unsafe, meaning that it was soon time to reopen after the construction works were finished.	"The majority of the council approved the extension of this bridge, considering that the city had to ""deal with traffic in particular"", so the road became closed when the work has finished."	The majority of the planning committee's decision to approve this cross was invalid, as the city had to deal with the problem of parking on wheels, thus the motion was taken that can be pulled back after the construction work has finished.	"Mehrheitlich wurde dem Umbau dieses Bahnübergangs die Zustimmung verweigert, da die Stadt Schiltach das Problem mit aufsitzenden Fahrzeugen ""ausbaden müsste"", so die Räte, da sich die Bahn nach Abschluss der Bauarbeiten aus der Verantwortung zurückziehen könne."
1271	"Having been positioned between the tracks ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Kuhbach"" is, for example, one of the problems facing the train terminals was it's connection to the train."	"It's not really difficult to look at the traces of the crossings ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Kuhbach"", as already crossings are carried out."	"The route ""Vor Heubach"" and ""Vor Kuhbach"" is difficult to see the junctions with the train, as well as the crossings already agreed on."	"Als unproblematisch betrachtet das Gremium die Umbauten an den Bahnübergängen ""Vor Heubach"" und ""Vor Kuhbach"", für die bereits Kreuzungsvereinbarungen mit der Bahn getroffen wurden."

1288	So it's already advisable to avoid the screams of frantic telephone calls in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai.	These things already require avoiding other than the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai from the noisy calls.	By and large, tourists are already skipping the noise-laden horns in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai.	So verzichten bereits unter anderem die Flughäfen in Kopenhagen, Frankfurt oder Dubai auf die lärmenden Aufrufe.
1289	Thanks to the way these transactions are handled - in average there are around 200 personal calls sent through the receptionist each day - it is planned that airport would be calmer soon.	Because this entanglement is followed by the means that this passage causes, in average, about 200 personal calls to be recorded via the telephone speaker per day, it should become more peaceful at the airport.	The way these passages are made, meaning there are about 200 personal calls parlayed through the speakers a day, it is likely to become more calm at the airport in future.	Durch den Wegfall dieser Durchsagen - im Durchschnitt ertönen an einem Tag rund 200 persönliche Aufrufe durch die Lautsprecher - soll es künftig ruhiger am Flughafen zugehen.

Sie sind nicht alle erfahrene Rennfahrer, sondern Leute, die auf der Suche nach Spannung und Abenteuer sind sowie nach einem erreichbaren Weg zu Weltklasse-Veranstaltungen.
1655	We're glad to be part of this partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and believe the format offers new possibilities to enjoy the varied sports events in the UK and abroad, as well as the potential for further enjoyment of the road race and the possible preparation for the possibility of outdoor Rally Raids.	We are glad to be a partner with Land Rover and the MSA and believe the Format offers new possibilities for touring across the United Kingdom and abroad and introducing new technologies to the road race track as well.	We are happy to join forces with Land Rover and MSA, and believe that the format of new possibilities allows for the prospect of a wide variety of road events in Britain and abroad, and the possibility of preparing for those exciting and exciting weekends in Spain and abroad, and the temptation to prepare for various Rallying Championships and Races, as well.	Wir freuen uns, diesen Weg in Partnerschaft mit Land Rover und der MSA eröffnen zu können und glauben, dass das Format neue Möglichkeiten erschließt, die verschiedenen Rally-Disziplinen in Großbritannien und dem Ausland zu erleben und Neulinge auf die Strapazen und die Wirklichkeit von Rally Raid vorzubereiten.
1656	We had real fun with the Defender Challenge – that'll become an interesting mini-series.	We had a lot of fun making the Defender Challenge weapon; this will be an underhanded match.	We had a really good time developing the Defender Challenge Weapon. It's going to become an inferior weapon.	Wir hatten wirklich Spaß daran, den Defender Challenge-Wagen zu entwickeln – das wird eine unterhaltsame Meisterschaft.
1657	In addition, in the Defender Challenge there's a training and test day in February, and the possibility of participating in the Olympic Games in North America and the southern hemisphere.	In addition, there is a training and test day in February, as well as the option to take part in the World Cup races in northern Africa and the US east coast.	On the other hand, the Defender's Challenge takes part in a training and test day in February, and the option of taking part in the races in the North Atlantic region and the Northern Mediterranean.	Darüber hinaus gibt es bei der Defender Challenge einen Trainings- und Testtag im Februar sowie die Option, an Wüstenrennen in Nordafrika und dem Nahen Osten teilzunehmen.
1658	George Kerevan: 'Union Football' gives the blacks the vote.	George Kerevan: European Parliament gives the suffragers the vote.	George Kerevan: European Union gives the Scots the right to vote.	George Kerevan: Europäische Entflechtung gibt den Schotten die Wahl
1659	A new day, a new journey to independence.	A new day, a new cycle of rejections of independence.	A new day, a new stage in our crisis for freedom.	Ein neuer Tag, eine neue Schreckensgeschichte zur Unabhängigkeit.
1660	We were warned that an independent Scotland was needed to enter the Schengen Round as a condition for joining the EU.	We are warned that it's necessary to form an independent Scotland to the conditions set out in the Paris Agreement.	This time, we're being warned that an independent Scotland is needed to enter the European Union as a condition for the entry of the treaty on the grounds of the Treaty.	Diesmal werden wir gewarnt, dass ein unabhängiges Schottland erforderlich sei, um dem Schengen-Raum als Bedingung für die EU-Mitgliedschaft beizutreten.
1661	It's the perfect for history of cruises in Berwick and gives you a balanced line between the Hadrian Wall and Hadrian Wall.	This is the slog to the town of Berwick, and a crossed border, with its chalk lined borders, is also a marker for the Hadrian Wall.	This is a journal which covers the area of coastal congestion and stretches along the whole of the Hadrian Wall.	Das liefert das Stichwort für Geschichten über Passkontrollen in Berwick und eine mit Stacheldraht gesicherte Grenze entlang des Hadrianswalls.
1662	In fact, in the Strathclyde petition, the economic benefits being offered by Greece for allowing more freedom of travel in other countries were not considered, but to summarise, it played no part in the sanctioned vote.	In fact, in the Strathclyde debate the possible economic benefits of allowing more freedom to travel in the resting European Union were put into account, but this incident, so to speak, didn't play any part in the traffic jam.	In fact, in the Strathclyde Convention, the possible economic advantages that bringing more freedom to travel in Europe would be, but this obviously didn't play a part in the ban on Turkish travel.	In der Tat wurde in der Strathclyde-Vorlage auf die möglichen wirtschaftlichen Vorteile hingewiesen, die mehr Reisefreiheit im restlichen Europa mit sich bringen würde, doch spielte dies – erwartungsgemäß – in den Schlagzeilen keine Rolle.
1663	Nobody mentioned that EU members often agree to their strict rules if they are cheaper for them.	No one has mentioned that the EU members often adopt their strict rules, when it's cheaper for them.	No one has mentioned that the EU member states frequently apply their strict rules when they are cheaper for them.	Auch hat niemand erwähnt, dass sich die EU-Mitgliedsstaaten häufig ihre strikten Regeln zurechtbiegen, wenn es für sie günstiger ist.
1664	Since Scotland's not currently on the Somme Road, the negotiated agreement would only be a minor concession to Brussels in favor of what they really want.	As Schotland is not currently a member of the Schengen Convention, the non-members of the convention would only consider a small amount of exemption from the strictest requirements for what it really requires.	As Scotland has not recently been to the Stockholm Convention, the instigated non-prohibition for Brussels would only be a little overstatement of what it really does mean to be from the Scottish people.	Da Schottland derzeit nicht zum Schengen-Raum gehört, wäre die fortgesetzte Nichtbeachtung für Brüssel nur ein kleines Zugeständnis im Gegenzug für das, was man wirklich von den Schotten will.
1665	Exactly no story.	Nothing really.	Also, that's not a story.	Also eigentlich keine Story.
1666	"And one who has already accumulated these years is that she already has a fossil fuel: the first time I heard the ""Independence means independence"", in at least 40 years ago."	"And one who has already come in the years, is that she is already doing a fossil: The first time I heard ""Independence means no-selection"" was when I was at least 40 years old."	"One, already so early in life, is that she already has a nuclear bomb: The first time I heard the ""Independence means follow-on activity"" sentence at least 40 years ago."	"Und eine, die schon so in der Jahre gekommen ist, dass sie bereits einem Fossil gleicht: Das erste Mal habe ich die „Unabhängigkeit bedeutet Passkontrollen""-Ente vor mindestens 40 Jahren gehört."
1667	This is an interesting point in the ongoing recollecting of this rather ancient tale.	This becomes an interesting point in retaking this ural story, which is frequently lost.	This is an interesting point in returning to this earlier story.	Dabei geht ein interessanter Punkt beim ständigen Wiederholen dieser uralten Geschichte verloren.
1668	Why should one expect an independent Scotland that is following the European standard?	Why should you expect an independent Scotland to dance in the European Parochiade?	Why would you expect an independent Scotland to dance following the European Pfeife?	Weshalb sollte man von einem unabhängigen Schottland erwarten, dass es nach der europäischen Pfeife tanzt?
1669	Why do Londoners decide against that of Brussels, particularly now?	Why is the Londoner joe being traded for the one in Brussels, especially now?	Why is the Londoner jockey compared to the one in Brussels, especially now?	Warum das Londoner Joch gegen das von Brüssel eintauschen, besonders jetzt?
1670	These are real European news: the huge plan for a union Europe, abandoned after the war, was put into operation.	They are the real European news: The big, after-war agreement for the union of Europe was signed into law.	These are really the European news: the massive plan for consolidation Europe, created after WWII, is mulling over.	Das sind die wirklichen europäischen Neuigkeiten: Der große, nach dem Krieg gefasste Plan zur Vereinigung Europas ist ins Stocken geraten.
1671	The Eurocrats officially approved the project Europe.	The European Commission officially ended the project Europe.	The europroject officially began.	Mit der Eurokrise ist das Projekt Europa offiziell gestorben.
1672	Throughout Europe, all parties to the EU’s territory will lose their EU-member countries or the Euro as a final member state shall take the EU membership.	All EU states agree to the ground on which the EU should be, or the Euro as a whole may elect to stay.	Almost all EU states agree on grounds that they or the Euro want to take over as long as it is EU-funded or Union countries wish to exchange currency.	Überall in der EU gewinnen Parteien an Boden, die EU-feindlich sind oder den Euro als Gemeinschaftswährung über Bord werfen möchten.
1673	Even in Germany the anti-EU party alternative – established only this year – was knapp five million votes at the election for the general election in September to elect and thus effectively the left-wing Liberal Democrats (amongst the British Liberal Democrats) were effectively mobilized by the July elections.	Even in Germany, the eskeptical party alternative for Germany, which was not founded until this year, was knapp five million votes at the elections in September to elect their representatives and effectively the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the UK Liberal Democrats) were successfully set off by the General Election.	Even in Germany the popular alternative to democracy – established not this year – was less than five million votes at the provincial election in September, effectively effectively verifying the independence of the Dutch Democrats (as opposed to the UK Liberal Democrats) on the ballot.	Selbst in Deutschland konnte die euroskeptische Partei Alternative für Deutschland – erst dieses Jahr gegründet – knapp fünf Millionen Stimmen bei der Bundestagswahl im September für sich ergattern und damit effektiv die Freien Demokraten (das Äquivalent zu den britischen Liberal Democrats) aus dem Bundestag vertreiben.
1674	There was always a secret resistance to the plan to create a more secular Europe.	There was always a silent resistance to the plan to build a more democratic Europe.	There was always insider resistance against the plan to create a free European Union.	Es gab schon immer heimischen Widerstand gegen den Plan, ein föderalistisches Europa zu schaffen.
1675	The latest economic calendar is perhaps worth a visit.	The latest economic report does not seem as interesting.	The current economic report is not exactly correct.	Die aktuelle Wirtschaftskrise stellt sich allerdings als Wendepunkt heraus.
1676	Because of the bounds between Berlin and the European Central Bank, in regards to what governs the national economy, many people think that the project Europe has gone too far.	Due to the adherence of Berlin and the European Central Bank to the social policy which is then used in the local economy, many people think that the project Europe was too far.	As Berlin and the European Central Bank have set a strict policy in relation to the economic policy which the country determines through the adoption of the framework for economic cooperation, many people think that Project Europe has gone too far.	Wegen der von Berlin und der Europäischen Zentralbank verhängten strengen Sparpolitik in Verbindung mit der Zwangsjacke, in die die jeweilige nationale Wirtschaft durch das Festhalten an der gemeinsamen Währung genötigt wird, sind viele Menschen der Ansicht, das Projekt Europa sei zu weit gegangen.
1677	The Euro crisis has little to do with the national governments suffering from high budgets — it was only Greece's fall.	The Euro crisis doesn't have much to do with national governments declaring extreme budget deficits, as in Greece.	The crisis of the euro doesn't mean that national governments are suffering from deficits in budgets – this was just the case in Greece.	Die Krise des Euro hat wenig damit zu tun, dass nationale Regierungen exzessive Haushaltsdefizite verursachen – das war nur in Griechenland der Fall.
1678	The euro zone's member states have set aside currency swap rates to be used by German exporters – and many German politicians want to do that.	The fact that the Eurozone has declared its members not to participate in currency exchanges has affected the Eurosystem – and most German politicians want to.	According to the Eurosystem's statistics, the number of members who are involved in the German export market has increased significantly – and German politicians would like to do this as well.	Stattdessen hat das Eurosystem seine Mitglieder auf Wechselkurse festgenagelt, die für deutsche Exporteure vorteilhaft sind – und das möchten deutsche Politiker gern so lassen.
1679	Without the possibility of a local economic recovery, South Europe with its largely negative competitive profile faces Germany again.	Without the possibility of a local currency, South Europe finds itself with an established competitive advantage over Germany.	Without the possibility of a regional adjustment, south Europe sees a competitive edge against Germany again.	Ohne die Möglichkeit einer Abwertung der lokalen Währung findet sich Südeuropa mit einem eingebauten Produktivitätsnachteil gegenüber Deutschland wieder.
1680	The only possible solution is to cut back on the broadcasts and speeches.	The only way to cut labor and public announcements is from Berlin.	The only possible way to shorten speeches and public announcements is by Berlin.	Die einzige Möglichkeit besteht darin, Löhne und öffentliche Ausgaben zu kürzen – angespornt von Berlin.
1681	Behind the current state and union problem lies a deeper industrial productivity problem.	Behind the current problems of state and economy is a deep problem of productivity in Europe.	A deeper problem in the current state of the economy lies behind the European productivity crisis.	Hinter den aktuellen Etat- und Währungsproblemen liegt ein tiefer gehendes europäisches Produktivitätsproblem.
1682	In consequence of the Brussels green energy directives, which have been adopted by the United States, the euro-Azerbaijani bill increases the double taxation on electricity and the fourth tax cut off for gas.	"In the aftermath of the Brussels-verified ""green"" energy accords – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies on the cost of the consumer – the European industry earned the double taxation for electricity and the fourth tax rate for gas, as well."	"In the wake of the Copenhagen-area ""green"" energy policies (a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies on behalf of the consumer) the European Union places the double quotient for electric tariffs in comparison to the United States, putting the fourth triplet for gas."	"Als Folge der von Brüssel verordneten „grünen"" Energierichtlinien – ein Code für die Subventionierung französischer und deutscher Energieunternehmen auf Kosten der Verbraucher – zahlt die europäische Industrie verglichen mit den Vereinigten Staaten das Doppelte für Elektrizität und das Vierfache für Gas."
1683	It isn't a significant cost, as we already saw in Grangemouth.	It's a bad idea, as we were able to see Grangemouth already.	It is a pretty minor inconvenience, as we could have seen in Grangemouth already.	Das ist ein lähmender Kostennachteil, wie wir bereits in Grangemouth sehen konnten.
1684	Every long-ago regulation of the world does not prevent the US investment in the industrialised countries from being stung by the oil price.	The United Nations prohibits all labor supply chains to Europe.	Every conspiracy in the world prevents Europe's petroleum industry from being entrapped by the United States.	Alle Lohnfestschreibungen der Welt schützen die europäische petrochemische Industrie nicht davor, von billigem amerikanischem Schiefergas in die Ecke gedrängt zu werden.
1685	Following that a revolution takes hold, especially in France, the leading European leadership.	The result is a revolt, particularly in France, the leading European nation.	Following the disaster, a revolution is coming on, particularly in France, which has led to the creation of the EU.	Als Folge zieht eine Revolte herauf, besonders in Frankreich, dem einstigen Cheerleader der EU.
1686	After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a small train, pulling from Germany to Washington.	After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a paedophile, where Germany could hold its breath and Paris could raise its mind to Washington.	After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vanguard, with which Germany was able to keep secret and Paris raised from its summit with Washington.	Nach dem Krieg sah die politische Elite Frankreichs die EU als ein Vehikel, mit dem man Deutschland in Schach halten und Paris auf Augenhöhe mit Washington heben konnte.
1687	But Berlin doesn't need Paris anymore than a means of political legitimacy and Europa has made his own economic policy, which has threatened the European economy.	But Berlin doesn't need Paris any more than the Tor to political legitimacy and a policy of economic development has pushed Europe towards a struggle against the democratically elected French economy.	But Berlin doesn't need Paris anymore as a platform for political legitimacy and has made Europe his own economic policy, undercutting the struggling French economy.	Doch Berlin braucht Paris nicht mehr als Tor zur politischen Legitimation und hat Europa seine eigene Wirtschaftspolitik aufgedrückt, womit die angeschlagene französische Wirtschaft zu kämpfen hat.
1688	The result: Justice for Marine Le Pen, EU-backed Front National has just won a decisive election and condemned the regents as Unionists on to place third.	The result: contrary to the law, Marine Le Pen has won a decisive last election, and left the ruling socialists on top of the group.	The result: Leave the bench to justice, ludicrous Front National wins decisive elections and positions three of the conservatives led to the race for the future.	Das Ergebnis: Marine Le Pens rechtsgerichteter, EU-feindlicher Front National hat gerade eine entscheidende Nachwahl gewonnen und damit die regierenden Sozialisten auf Platz drei verwiesen.
1689	The Front National is now the most popular party in France with a majority of the vote. This is an appropriate warning to the British Labour Party that they can't go beyond it and any form of curse would bring about harm to the link.	The Front National is the most popular party in France, with 24 percent of the vote. This is a fair warning for the British Labour Party that they can't deal with politics because it means victory to the link.	The Front National is the country's most popular party with 24 percent of its vote; a righteous warning for the British Labour Party, they can't ignore that if there were no words in the correct spelling, it would make perfect sense to the link.	Der Front National ist nun die beliebteste Partei in Frankreich mit 24 Prozent der Wählerstimmen – eine zeitgerechte Warnung für die britische Labour-Partei, dass sie nicht davon ausgehen kann, eine Spaltung im rechten Spektrum würde automatisch Vorteile für die Linke bedeuten.
1690	What makes the pen, given its newly gained popularity among white workers?	What does the pen with her newly gained popularity among the white French workers?	What makes the pen popular among white-speakers of the working class?	Was macht Le Pen mit ihrer neu gewonnen Popularität unter den weißen Franzosen der Arbeiterklasse?
1691	She'd like to use the EU elections next year to put up with an anti-EU, anti-government measure in the European Parliament.	She would like to use the EU's other measures next year to secure a vote against the EU and an anti-EU ban on EU citizens.	She'd like to use the EU referendum next year to seek to put an anti-EU, anti-federal sanctions in the European Parliament.	Sie möchte die EU-Wahlen nächstes Jahr dazu nutzen, einen Anti-EU-, Anti-Gemeinschaftswährungsblock im Europäischen Parlament zu schmieden.
1692	If the EU-Partners are beneficial in these elections – and that is very likely – then it could first become a block of parliaments which holds power.	If the anti-EU voting decisions are well thought through, and it is very likely, a block of these votes could first be decided by the European Parliament.	If the anti-EU votes are put in place right away, and that's very possible, then it could become a block of EU parliament for the first time.	Falls die Anti-EU-Parteien bei diesen Wahlen gut abschneiden – und das ist sehr gut möglich –, dann könnte erstmals ein solcher Block das Europäische Parlament dominieren.
1693	This is the point on which I want to focus: In not a long-term future, the growing anger against EU and the common effort to repeal the euro will not disappear.	That's the point I want to leave on: In not very far future, the growing anger against the EU and the common march towards the abandonment of the Euro will not go away.	This is the point beyond which I want to go: in not a long-term future, the growing resistance against the EU and the general refusal to scrap the Euro will not be discussed.	Dies ist der Punkt, auf den ich hinaus will: In nicht allzu ferner Zukunft wird das wachsende Ressentiment gegen die EU und die gemeinsame Währung sich zur Abschaffung des Euro zusammenfinden.
1694	"The EU will not disappear, but it will soon become the ""European Union of State that General de Gaulle promoted."	"The EU won't disappear, but she will become as much as the ""European Union of States"", which General de Gaulle promoted."	"The EU will not disappear, but she will soon be shaped like the ""Europa of (souverän) countries"" that General de Gaulle favoured."	"Die EU wird nicht verschwinden, aber sie wird eher so etwas wie das „Europa der (souveränen) Nationen"" werden, das General de Gaulle favorisierte."
1695	Germany and a few of its satellite networks might be at stake in the Euro, but France and South-East Europe are going to their own ways.	Germany and a few of his satellite countries may be at the Europoint, but France and South-East Europe will return to their own rules.	Germany and some of its satellites might be at the end of the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own spheres.	Deutschland und ein paar seiner Satelliten-Wirtschaften halten vielleicht am Euro fest, aber Frankreich und Südeuropa werden zu ihren eigenen Währungen zurückkehren.
1696	I suspect that the great-grandpaed for trying to settle into the USA might dissociate from this project.	I anticipate that Britain's participation in this project will dilute their hopes of joining the USA.	I expect that many British citizens will disavowed this project in hopes of returning to the USA.	Ich erwarte, dass sich Großbritannien von diesem Projekt distanziert in der Hoffnung, sich bei den USA einzuschmeicheln.
1697	However, Washington's growing interest in a possible change in the Pacific region suggests that Britain should stand alone in the Atlantic.	However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic.	However, Washington's interest in the Pacific region is mounting that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic Ocean.	Allerdings legt Washingtons wachsendes Interesse am Pazifikraum nahe, dass Großbritannien allein im atlantischen Regen stehen wird.
1698	Where's Scotland all the way?	Where will Scotland stay after all these years?	Where is Scotland all year round?	Wo bleibt Schottland bei all dem?
1699	We can decide to be a small island in the future.	We can choose to be a region that is not really English.	We can decide to be a region of the world that, in reality, is called English Klein.	Wir können entscheiden, eine Region von (in letzter Konsequenz) Klein-England zu sein.
1700	Or we can defend our own economic interests – what's it not worth to tell Berlin and Brussels about what they can do to themselves.	Or we can defend our own economic interests. This also means telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do in Brussels.	Or we can defend our own economic interests – as in saying Berlin and Brussels what they can do.	Oder wir können unsere eigenen wirtschaftlichen Interessen verteidigen – wozu auch gehört, Berlin und Brüssel zu sagen, was sie sich wo hinstecken können.
1701	I think Schottland could possibly go to a more diverse European neighbourhood quite well, provided we keep our own way.	I suppose Schottland could have a good reputation in an increasingly crowded European region, if we keep our own ways.	I guess Scotland could travel in a more rugged European area if we kept our own rules.	Ich vermute, Schottland könnte in einem lockereren europäischen Verbund ganz gut fahren, sofern wir unsere eigene Währung behalten.
1702	Co-operation with other, similar thinker countries is not easy in a democratic Europe.	Co-operation with other countries of similar aims is more common in an unfettered Europe of nations.	Co-operation with other, similar thinking countries is no longer easier in a friendly Europe.	Die Kooperation mit anderen, ähnlich denkenden Ländern ist in einem nicht föderierten Europa der Nationen einfacher.
1703	In general, we should consider whether or not it will happen again and continue our economic independence.	Otherwise we should consider keeping our economic independence.	We should aim to stay out of debt in general and keep our independence.	Ansonsten sollten wir erwägen, es Norwegen gleichzutun und unsere wirtschaftliche Unabhängigkeit behalten.
1704	SNP in Scotland is the most successful political movement against the fall of the European Union, having won a dramatic majority because of the Abletion of the crucial (and pre-empted) negotiations that labour minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Coalition backs to the Labour Party.	SNP in Scotland is, by far, the successful political movement against the partition of Europe and won a huge majority in 2011 due to the success of the failed (and supported) changes that Labour-Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Liberal Democrat coalition were answering.	The SNP in Scotland is, notably, the successful and most significant change to the present European Union, having won a significant majority because of the acceptance of the proposed changes (and subsequent policies) that Labour-backed Minister for Finance Alistair Darling and the following coalition government's parliamentary reform were implemented.	Die SNP-Regierung in Schottland ist – bemerkenswerterweise – die erfolgreichste politische Bewegung gegen die Sparpolitik in Europa und hat 2011 eine spektakuläre Mehrheit aufgrund der Ablehnung der vorgeschlagenen (und vorgenommenen) Kürzungen gewonnen, die der Labour-Finanzminister Alistair Darling und die nachfolgende Tory-Lib Dem-Koalition zu verantworten hatten.
1705	It'd be a mistake to decide now whether to accept a status quo, only to then get an alternative from Berlin and Brussels.	For Scotland to decide on the basis of an independent future only to get a deal signed between Berlin and Brussels would be absurd.	Schottland is seriously considering going independent now only to get involved in the decision of Berlin and Brussels.	Es wäre für Schottland lächerlich, sich jetzt für eine Unabhängigkeit zu entscheiden, nur um dann von Berlin und Brüssel eine Sparpolitik aufgezwungen zu bekommen.
1706	FAA: Pilots can now use electronic devices in aircraft (don't conduct mobile phone calls).	FAA: Flight attendants may now use electronic devices in airplanes (although they don't allow mobile calls).	FAA: pilots may now use electronic devices in aircraft (that's not conducive to mobile phone calls).

Travellers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, listen to music and watch movies, not but using the mobile phone, as the Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday.	Those who travel by plane can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen and watch movies, not in the phone, as were the new guidelines released on the Thursday of the Federal Aviation Administration.	Flugreisende können jetzt vom Abflug bis zur Landung ihre elektronischen Geräte zum Lesen, Arbeiten, Spielen, Musik hören und dem Ansehen von Filmen verwenden, nicht aber mit dem Handy telefonieren, so die neuen Richtlinien, die am Donnerstag von der Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in den USA herausgegeben wurden.
1708	But the Palestinians shouldn't expect these changes to be immediately implemented.	However, the travelers shouldn't expect to be implemented immediately.	The Passagiere should not expect these changes being immediately implemented.	Doch sollten die Passagiere nicht erwarten, dass diese Änderungen sofort umgesetzt werden.
1709	How fast they'd be implemented depend on the specific airline, Mr. Huerta, working at the FAA press conference, explained Michael Huerta to a press conference.	How quickly they would be implemented would depend on the carrier, said FAA chief executive Michael Huerta at a press conference.	How quickly they'd be implemented depends on the specific airline, a press conference explained that FAA-Mitarbeiter Michael Huerta.	Wie schnell sie implementiert würden, hinge von der jeweiligen Fluggesellschaft ab, erklärte FAA-Mitarbeiter Michael Huerta auf einer Pressekonferenz.
1710	The airlines must prove to the FAA that the new rules apply and that the regulations governing the handling of aircraft, including the provisions for the safekeeping of devices according to the new rules have been updated.	The airlines have to prove that they comply with the new directives and that they update the Handbook of Flight Personnel, as well.	The airlines must prove to the FAA that their airline rules are correct and that its manuals on handling personal equipment and the regulations for the maintenance of equipment have been updated in line with the new rules.	Die Fluggesellschaften müssen der FAA nachweisen, dass Flugzeuge den neuen Richtlinien entsprechen und dass sie die Schulungshandbücher des Flugpersonals sowie die Regelungen für das Verstauen der Geräte entsprechend der neuen Vorschriften aktualisiert haben.
1711	The FAA explained that she'd already received plans from several airlines to use portable electronic devices in airplanes.	The FAA explained that she had already been contacted by several airlines who wanted to implement more complicated electronic devices into planes.	The FAA said that she had already received plans from several airlines to use portable electronic devices in planes.	Die FAA erklärte, sie habe bereits von einigen Fluggesellschaften Pläne erhalten, die den Einsatz tragbarer elektronischer Geräte in Flugzeugen ausbauen möchten.
1712	These airlines, too, operated by Delta and JetBlue.	These airlines were Delta and JetBlue, as well.	These airlines also operated in Delta and JetBlue.	Unter diesen Fluggesellschaften waren auch Delta und JetBlue.
1713	In the event that plans were to make use of electronic devices, the FAA said that it would cease using them.	If the plan is going to allow for the use of electronic devices very soon, the FAA signaled that they were in the business.	We might take the advantage of the expansion of use of electronic devices very soon, a FAA official confirmed.	"„Je nach Zustand des Plans könnten wir die erweiterte Nutzung elektronischer Geräte sehr bald genehmigen"", gab die FAA in einer Verlautbarung bekannt."
1714	It's time to turn off your mobile, tablet and other devices when the aircraft door shuts.	You must turn off your mobile phone, tablet and other devices when the airport doors close.	At the same time, you need to turn off your mobile phones, tablets and other devices when the plane doors are shut.	Derzeit müssen Passagiere Smartphones, Tablets und andere Geräte abschalten, wenn die Flugzeugtüren geschlossen werden.
1715	You can't start again until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.	You're not allowed to start again when the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the capit is illuminated with green light.	They can't begin until the plane has reached a height of three kilometres, and the cabin lights out.	Sie dürfen sie erst dann wieder starten, wenn das Flugzeug eine Höhe von drei Kilometern erreicht hat und der Kapitän grünes Licht gibt.
1716	They must stop again when the planes are set to go and not take off again when it is first landed.	When entering the land flight, the passengers must switch on again and they shouldn't start again once the plane has landed.	They have to turn off again on landing, but they are not allowed to take off again after landing.	Beim Eintritt in den Landeanflug müssen die Fluggäste sie wieder abschalten und dürfen sie nicht wieder starten, ehe das Flugzeug gelandet ist.
1717	The new rules could allow airlines who protect aircraft against electronic interference to permit their passengers to use the devices during flight, landing and on the road, explained the FAA.	In light of the new directives, airlines that are supposed to protect aircraft from electronic failure may allow their passengers to use equipment on-board, during landing and in the event of an emergency, the FAA explained.	Under the new directive, airlines whose planes are protected from electronic failures may permit their passengers to use the devices during start, landing and in flight, said the FAA.	Nach den neuen Richtlinien könnten Fluggesellschaften, deren Flugzeuge gegen elektronische Störungen gesichert seien, ihren Passagieren erlauben, die Geräte auch bei Start, Landung und auf dem Rollfeld zu verwenden, erklärte die FAA.
1718	The most recent aircraft and other boats which were introduced to allow for the use of Wi-Fi in cities should meet the criteria.	The majority of new transporters and other planes requiring greater elevation should conform to the criteria for Wi-Fi use.	The most recent aircraft and other commercial planes which were designed to enable the use of Wi-Fi in higher elevations should meet the criteria.	Die meisten neuen Verkehrsflugzeuge und andere Flieger, die für die Verwendung von Wi-Fi in größeren Höhen umgerüstet wurden, sollten den Kriterien entsprechen.
1719	Laura Glading, president of the professional association of aegeologists, welcomed the changes.	Laura Glading, president of the professional association of pilots, welcomed the changes.	Laura Glading, president of the professional association of flight attendants, welcomed the changes.	Laura Glading, Präsidentin des Berufsverbands professioneller Flugbegleiter, begrüßte die Änderungen.
1720	"When the new regulation is met with legal certainty, and we will work closely with the airline, both sides will benefit,"" jokingly concluded the letter."	"When the new rules are made law and we work closely with the airlines, both sides will benefit,"" a cameron said."	"When the new regulation is being implemented, and we're working closely with the airline to ensure that both sides are pleased,"" concluded Glading."	"„Wenn die neue Regelung sicher umgesetzt ist – und wir arbeiten diesbezüglich eng mit der Fluggesellschaft zusammen –, werden beide Seite davon profitieren"", kommentierte Glading."

A drainage underpass was carried out in partnership with the neighbouring village of Harlingen, which is now the basis for the statutory scheme for the protection of the riverbanks in Gching.	Eine Flussgebietsuntersuchung war mit der Nachbargemeinde Aidlingen in Auftrag gegeben worden, die nun Grundlage für das Hochwasserschutzkonzept in Gechingen ist.
1800	The aim of protecting as much land as possible, argues the preacher.	The goal is to build as much of a scheme as possible, said the keeper.	As the builders, the gardeners say, protecting the most cultivated land is the aim.	"""Der Schutz möglichst vieler bebauter Grundstücke ist das Ziel"", so Häußler."
1801	To make up for the delay was planning to attend a survey by the German weather service for all hundred years to expect high water.	The clockwork involves planning for all the past 100 years to be ready for high water, according to a German weather service.	The final piece of the puzzle is the planning of the defence against a big German weather service mandate that predicted all the expected high water events for all 100 years.	Zugrunde gelegt ist der Planung der Schutz vor einem laut Deutschen Wetterdienst statistisch alle 100 Jahre zu erwartenden Hochwasser.
1802	The climate change is managed by a fifteen-pronged approach.	The climate change will be addressed through a 15-pronged scale.	The changes in climate will be managed by a fifteen-pronged solution.	Der Klimaveränderung wird durch einen 15-prozentigen Zuschlag Rechnung getragen.

Die Wassermassen, die 2009 in Gechingen zu beträchtlichen Schäden geführt hatten, entsprachen einem 1000-jährigen Hochwasser.
1805	It is not possible to get absolute protection, but a relative improvement can be achieved, according to the shaman.	There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement, said Häudler.	There's no absolute protection, but there's an relative improvement, says Häufler.	"""Einen absoluten Schutz gibt es nicht, aber eine relative Verbesserung können wir erzielen"", so Häußler."
1806	To achieve the 100% efficiency of 100aKlima, it has to be invested around four million euro, and the village slashing in section is made up of at least 70 percent people.	To achieve the Headquarters 100a Climate, you've got to spend around four million euro in tenders, where the town of Lancaster can equalise about 70 percent.	To achieve the number of employees HQ 100aKlimat, four million Euro must be invested in toch costs, while the town of St. Katherine can count on budgets of around 70 percent.	Um den Schutz HQ 100aKlima zu erzielen, müssen in Gechingen rund vier Millionen Euro investiert werden, wobei die Gemeinde mit Landeszuschüssen in Höhe von rund 70 Prozent rechnen kann.
1807	However, some councils insist that only the promotion of a particular concept should be implemented.	Nevertheless, some people think that promotion should only be done when there's a comprehensive plan achieved.	Rather than ask questions, those who want to raise this are just going to have it implemented in whole.	Häußler wies aber darauf hin, dass es die Förderung nur gebe, wenn ein Gesamtkonzept umgesetzt werde.
1808	A community was therefore urged to take into account the impact of citizens.	The community was then put in the lead.	This is how the community assessed the impact of the citizens.	Dazu sei die Gemeinde auf die Mitwirkung der Bürger angewiesen.
1809	A planning and approval process is required in order to complete it.	The planning and approval process must be completed on time.	Developing and implementing plans and procedures have to be completed in advance.	Ein aufwändiges Planungs- und Genehmigungsverfahren müsse absolviert werden.
1810	In the best case, 2016 can be started with the implementation.	In the best case, 2016 should begin with the implementation.	On the best case, 2016 can begin with the implementation.	Im besten Fall könne 2016 mit der Umsetzung begonnen werden.
1811	Among others, see the precaution plan announced last week in the parish council (we reported local measures along the riverbank) which we have previously proposed to the community.	In particular, the plan for protecting the creek flowing out of the Stammheim was reported earlier last week.	Among the measures listed are those already in the community council discussed (we reported) local measures to protect from the flow of the river.	Unter anderem sieht das Schutzkonzept, das bereits in der vergangenen Woche im Gemeinderat präsentiert wurde (wir berichteten) lokale Maßnahmen im Zufluss des Flüsschens Irm aus dem Stammheimer Tal vor.
1812	In the aftershock presentation of the comprehensive approach, the participants used the opportunity to present their concerns.	Following the presentation on the high water management concepts, participants had the opportunity to raise their concerns.	In the follow-up to the presentation on the concept of flood control, participants used the opportunity to bring their concerns.	Im Anschluss an die Präsentation des Hochwasserschutzkonzepts nutzten die Teilnehmer die Gelegenheit, ihre Anliegen einzubringen.
1813	A question was raised among others why there were no plans to set up more ponds and drains to protect the garden.	That's been raised among others why there are no plans for more beaches and retreat areas to protect the ortes.	Several questions were raised, namely why aren't more dams and waterfalls planned for the protection of the birds.	Unter anderem wurde in Frage gestellt, warum nicht mehr Dämme und Rückhaltebecken zum Schutz des Ortes geplant seien.
1814	Gregor K. Wright, technical advisor to the European Union's Agency for Sustainable Development, stressed that it was necessary to use all the measures presented to achieve the desired result.	Gregor Kühne, consultant at the department of climate and climatology in Hedgeheim, highlighted the need for all the measures presented to reach the desired end.	Gregor Cowan, who proposed the concept, stressed that it was necessary to coordinate all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal.	Gregor Kühn, Fachplaner des beauftragten Ingenieurbüros Wald und Corbe aus Hügelsheim, der das Konzept vorstellte, betonte, dass es das Zusammenspiel aller vorgestellten Maßnahmen benötige, um in der Summe das gewünschte Ziel zu erreichen.
1815	Further to the end, the costliest solution was found, namely: Jensen Waldeous and Corbet.	More precisely, the economically feasible solution, namely John's forest from the other side of the fence, was kept to be found.	Then the economically feasible solution was found, Joachim Wald from forest to field.	Darüber hinaus sei man gehalten die wirtschaftlichste Lösung zu finden, so Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
1816	Unmutual aggression stung those who, at normal times, were constantly suffering from an overload of the canal network.	Those who tended to be alright, who once again fell victim to a straining of the canal network, were always at pain.	Inadvertence was prevalent among seekers of ancient, even if they themselves have always fallen under a straining of the canal.	Unmut herrschte bei Anliegern des Altorts, die selbst bei normalen Gewitterregen immer wieder unter einer Überlastung des Kanalnetzes zu leiden haben.
1817	The problem is known in the administration, and first steps have already been taken.	The problem is well-known in the administration, and first steps have already been taken.	The problem is known in the management and first measures have already been taken.	Das Problem ist bei der Verwaltung bekannt und erste Maßnahmen wurden bereits ergriffen.
1818	However, some builders insist that the guidelines for canal systems are different than those for water-resistant systems and won't be pushed or harmed.	However, the judges advised that the rules for canals which aren't meant to protect against floods and are not enforceable should they be followed.	Nevertheless, some should check that the rules for canals are other than those for flood control and don't be inserted.	Häußler wies jedoch darauf hin, dass die Richtlinien für Kanalsysteme andere seien, als für den Hochwasserschutz und dies nicht vermischt werden dürfe.
1819	The municipality is obliged to establish the canal network such that it can host two or three years of rainy weather.	The village was obliged to develop the canal network so as to permit two-to-three years of rain.	The municipality is obliged to administer the canal network so that it can support two-and-a-third annual rainfall.	Die Gemeinde sei verpflichtet, das Kanalnetz so auszulegen, dass zwei- bis dreijährige Regenereignisse verkraftet werden könnten.
1820	The ocean's dimensions are growing so that millions of people would slip.	The ocean's dimensions are large enough to collapse millions of square feet.	If the scale of the containers grew, millions would disappear.	Die Abwasserkanäle größer zu dimensionieren, würde Millionen verschlingen.

1825	If you visit the same café at Block 4 in the vicinity of the high school Rhein-Way, it doesn't have to stay if there is shivering in the real world.	When visiting the same coffee shop opposite the city hall near the high school for Rhine-Westphalia, it must not stay cold during the intense drier months.	When visiting the same café on the corner of the town hall near the University of Ruhr-Waal, it is not necessary to stay in the winter chill when it isn't dripping.	Im Falle des Besuchs des gleichnamigen Cafés am Opschlag in der Kreisstadt Kleve in Sichtweite zur Hochschule Rhein-Waal muss es nicht beim reinen Déjà Vu-Gefühl bleiben.
1826	In the end, the cafeteria with its beautiful name precisely did the thing: a lasting stay not only at the café, but a habitable staying who does is more likely to repeat a drink.	Finally, the café named with such a lovely name exactly what you want to have — stay not only relaxing, but also memorable.	Finally, the coffee shop with its lovely name is exactly what it was meant to be: not only do you stay, but a long-lasting one, especially when you are willing to return.

It's a rule that there are more sexual predators, but it is becoming more and more sophisticated for producers to influence the decisions.	Increasing freedom of flight is becoming a norm for aircraft engineers and manufacturers, but increasing importance of how they use them increases.

1884	The commentators' statement in the results partly relates to the fact that the 777X will be able to carry its ten seats on board with the original design of nine seats in the 777.	The statements made by Boeing about the results partly depend on the fact that the 777X was replaced by its original design by nine seats in the 777.	The Boeing ax's assertions regarding the results partly depend on the fact that the 787X, with its ten seats above the original design, will be replaced by the 787-X with its nine seats.

Consequently, Boeing is tinkering in its planes to be competitive with our products, says Kevin Keniston, manager for passenger comfort at European Airbus.	Building on board often causes construction to take longer to do his plane in order to be able to compete with our products, says Kevin Keniston, manager of passenger comfort at European Airbus.	"„Boeing quetscht deshalb mehr Sitze in sein Flugzeug, um es wettbewerbsfähiger zu unseren Produkten zu machen"", sagt Kevin Keniston, Leiter für Passagierkomfort bei der europäischen Airbus."
1887	According to other analysts, operating planes with ten seats were all designed so as not to permit the decision of passengers on the ground floor how to fly onboard with cheaper tickets.	Similarly, analysts asserted that even in the presence of ten seats affected decisions by passengers which were cheaper to do with onboard baggage.	However, analysts say that all the seats in the existing 777 are so high that they argue that there were a lot of passengers to decide what to do with the cheaper plane tickets.	Andererseits sagen Analysten, volle Kabinen mit zehn Sitzen pro Reihe bei vorhandenen 777s deuteten darauf hin, dass sich viele Passagiere für die engere Anordnung entschieden, was mit billigeren Flugtarifen einhergehen könnte.
1888	The height of eighteen feet would be ideal for regular passengers, but the practicality is: from a budget point of view, the airbus service on the 777 is regulated by the Business Desk, Ms Kirby, founder and manager of Runway Girl Network.	"Airbus's offering of over 1040 seat sizes was ideal for passengers, but the appeal is that, in terms of cost, the business plan on handing down the 777 is quite different. ""On a technical point, Mary Kirby, founder and executive producer of Runway Girl Network says that she and their staff are responsible for the founding and development of Runway Girl Network."""	Whether or not eight hundred seat widths would be great for passengers, the practicality is: As a matter of economics, the Airbus contract for Kabineninstallation, founder and creator of Runway Girl Network, Mary Kirby, advises the Running Girls Network.	"„Achtzehn Zoll Sitzbreite wären toll für Passagiere, aber die Wirklichkeit ist: von einem wirtschaftlichen Gesichtspunkt aus ist das Airbus-Angebot von der Bedrohung durch die 777 gesteuert"", sagt Mary Kirby, Expertin für Kabineneinrichtung, Gründerin und Herausgeberin von Runway Girl Network."

1891	Even though they offer the comfort at a reasonable price, all manufacturers provide jets with much-trained crews for direct flights and regional flight.	Even if they price the comfort, all jets producers are offering superior offers for passengers travelling with or without flights.	While they offer the same level of comfort, all airline and regional airlines also offer attractive pricing.	Selbst wenn sie den Komfort anpreisen, so bieten doch alle Hersteller auch Jets mit hochverdichteter Ausgestaltung für Billigfluglinien und regionale Flüge.

Bis vor kurzem hat Airbus betont, wie wichtig mehr Anpassbarkeit der Kabinen sei und für einige Jets breite Sitze an den Gängen angeboten.
1894	Without the support of only other manufacturers of large modern jets, experts say that reputation for a new standard will probably decline, but at the end of the day, from the standpoint of Boeing 777X, it could be created by the need for more aircraft to sell.	Without the support of only other manufacturers of major modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new standard will likely decline, but from the perspective of the Boeing 787X sales force it could be won't be accessible to buyers.

1898	We can ask any questions that we have, but closer examination of the vegan diet looks like a global sustainability issue.	What remains is subject to scrutiny, but more closely a look at the vegan diet results in a favourably biased approach.

Was bleibt, mag man sich fragen, doch bei näherer Betrachtung zeichnet sich die vegane Ernährungswelt durch einen beachtlichen Einfallsreichtum aus.

1908	"The fact that it isn't a double bonus, says Proctor today, ""makes you vegan not really have to be, and instead of just being an option,"" prompting Proctor to lower his diet further adds up to the fact that he has reduced the number of options."	"The added bonus of veganism is not that it's ""a good idea, no harm"" but rather that one's going to reduce the options as a whole. Proctor further conceded that the emphasis on choices when eating out of favour only encourages further reduction in the number of food options."	"The option of keeping the option vegan is a double bonus, says Proctor today, ""although suddenly the temptation to turn vegan isn't so much as agreeing with the menu but rather an exercise in predetermined control."" The claim that the menu will make up for the reduction of choices between the options which eventually put him back to the norm further and further urges him to reconsider the treatment of the matter."	"""Es ist ein doppelter Bonus"", sagt Proctor heute, ""tatsächlich stellt vegan sein keinen Verzicht, keine Askese dar, sondern es ist eine Bereicherung"". Die Annahme, dass man mit der Ernährungsumstellung die Auswahl an Speiseoptionen reduziere, führt Proctor eher auf die Macht der Gewohnheit zurück."
1909	Exactly those conditions made many attempts so well-intentioned.	It only made sense that the following conditions were necessary for some even so well-meaning attempts.	This precise conditioning also encouraged some yet so well-known attempts to conceive.	Und genau diese Konditionierungen ließen auch manchen noch so gut gemeinten Versuch scheitern.
1910	The factor of location is a very important factor to consider when comparing results with other factors, such as smoking.	The factor of food selection is an important factor which can be easily manipulated, as in smoking.	The fact that a personality is completely dependent upon, like smoking, makes study possible.	"""Der Suchtfaktor ist ein ganz entscheidender Faktor, der viele schnell aufgeben lässt, ähnlich wie beim Rauchen"", stellt Proctor einen Vergleich auf."
1911	"And be make an injunction: ""Which gruffs don't like to be tied down""."	"And thou says: ""Best friends aren't tied to the animal""."	"And the verse goes, ""Safety is not your enemy""."	"Und wendet ein: ""Bestimmte Geschmäcker sind nicht am Tier festzumachen""."

"In Double Down, a claim that the top of the queue failed to allow bids on a ""serious set of personal relations"" finally came when the data proved that the presidential candidate's ""potential for Barack Obama did not significantly improve"", says the publication."	"Apparently, ""in Double Down"" some people claimed that they had made the decision to bid on behalf of their ""immedicated personal relationships,"" before finally being decided upon the basis of which the data showed that the candidate for president Clinton's ""the chances of Obama won't be significantly improved"""	"In „Double Down"" wird behauptet, Daley habe an der Spitze der Bemühungen gestanden, Biden trotz ihres „engen, persönlichen Verhältnisses"" auszutauschen, ehe man sich schließlich gegen einen solchen Schachzug entschied, nachdem die Daten zeigten, dass die Kandidatur Clintons „die Chancen Obamas nicht maßgeblich verbessern"" würde."

I included a whole range of things to take into account, and this was one of them, said the magazine.	I pointed out a whole host of things that should be taken into consideration, and that was just one of them, explained the magazine.	"„Ich äußerte eine ganze Reihe von Dingen, die man in Erwägung ziehen sollte, und das war eines davon"", erklärte Daley dem Magazin."
2881	"Remember that the President at the time asked for urgent questions, so we must recall: ""God's call, what shall we do?"""	"Remembering that the President was afraid of irrelevant questions, we must ask: ""What do you want us to do?"""	"Remember that the president had many such questions at the time and asked: ""What do we do for God?"""	"Man muss sich in Erinnerung rufen, dass der Präsident damals furchtbare Umfragewerte hatte, also dachten wir: „Um Gottes Willen, was machen wir?"""
2882	"In the process of being described as ""assuring the faithful,"" Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that he had been planning to invest significant effort in finding out whether such a train would reach the voting booth."	"While the debate called the investigation ""the offering of sorgfalt"" Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that it had been significant effort spent to determine whether or not a similar train arrived before the election day."	"While considering the issues which described the election as ""opening ceremony"", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that he had spent a lot of time researching whether a referendum train at the moment reached the polling booth."	"Während Daley die Untersuchungen als „gebotene Sorgfalt"" bezeichnete, sagte Martin gegenüber Anderson Cooper von CNN, dass während der Kampagne für die Wiederwahl erheblicher Aufwand betrieben worden sei, um herauszufinden, ob ein solcher Zug sich im Hinblick auf die Wahlurnen auszahle."
2883	It is not worth spending that much money on campaigns if you don't think seriously about something related, explained Martin on AC360.	When you don't consider something besides, Martin explained at AC360.	When it doesn't really matter, Martin explained at AC360.	"„In Kampagnen wird nicht so viel Geld für Umfragen und Fokusgruppen ausgegeben, wenn man nicht ernsthaft über etwas nachdenkt"", erklärte Martin auf AC360."
2884	It isn't clear if Obama knew that his team was considering an exchange.	It isn't clear yet whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange.

2886	"Even though Daley said that he didn't think that the president of the possible change was ""seen"", the earlier Stabschef said that it could have been ""possible"" for Obama to have known."	"Even though Daley explained he did not think that the President of the possible change ""didn't know"", the earlier Senator said that it was ""possible"" for him to have known about Obama."	"Even though Daley explained that he did not think the President of possible change was aware, the former cabinet member admitted it was ""possible"" to have known Obama about it."	"Wenngleich Daley erklärte, er glaube nicht, dass sich der Präsident der möglichen Veränderung „bewusst war"", gab der frühere Stabschef zu, es sei „möglich"" gewesen, dass Obama davon gewusst habe."
2887	"Martin added that he thought that ""double down"" wasn't really an answer to the question whether the political negotiations Obama reached at the table had been successful."	Martin added that he didn't think that the political reversal of Obama's speech provided a definitive answer.	"Martin said he thought that 'three in the barrel"" was not a definitive answer to the question whether the political negotiations President Obama reached on the table had been made."	"Martin fügte hinzu, dass „Double Down"" keine definitive Antwort auf die Frage liefere, ob die politischen Sondierungen Obamas Schreibtisch erreicht hätten."

As often as council meetings revolve around the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.	Immer wenn es in Gemeinderatssitzungen um den Haushalt geht, hat Bürgermeister Ralph Gerster gut lachen.
2892	The town's baker's market in Herdwick is well-stocked and the administration has not been keen to turn down any clients since 2005.	The croft of Herdwangen is well-stocked, and the head office hasn't been closed since 2005.	The area of the Herdway Shoehouse is well stocked, and the management haven't been doing any work since 2005.	Das Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach ist gut gefüllt und Schulden kennt die Verwaltung bereits seit 2005 nicht mehr.
2893	Even the fiscal year 2012 can be described as a full success.	Even the Haushalts year 2012 can be described as a success full stop.	Even the budget year 2012 can be declared a success even as it does not.	Auch das Haushaltsjahr 2012 kann in diesem Sinne als voller Erfolg verbucht werden.
2894	That was very evident in the invoice for 2012 presentation.	This was clearly made clear when the year-end statement for 2012 was presented.	This was evident at the beginning of the year 2012 account.	Dies wurde bei der Vorstellung der Jahresrechnung für 2012 deutlich.
2895	As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administration budget was about 7,6 million euros more than planned.	Andrew Rothmund explained that the budget for the administration was about 7,6 million euro, and a million euros higher than planned.	According to Andrea Rothmund, the budget for the government was about six million euros over a million euro higher than planned.	Wie Andrea Rothmund erläuterte, sei der Verwaltungshaushalt mit rund 7,6 Millionen Euro über eine Millionen Euro höher ausgefallen als geplant.
2896	Even the budget of the office was reduced by about 1.8 million euros, which is less than the budget figure.	Even the surplus of the budget was about eight million euros, a little over a million euro less than the figure set aside.	Even the budget deficit was about one million euros, slightly more than the budget.	Auch der Überschuss des Verwaltungshaushaltes liege mit etwa 1,8 Millionen Euro rund eine Millionen Euro über dem Ansatz.
2897	Having been able to pay above the income tax, and the municipal salary increase were important.	To add on, the deduction for VAT and the contribution of the community to the income taxation were made a significant benefit.	They are grateful for overtaking the local income tax and the council tax.	Zu verdanken sei der Überschuss vor allem höheren Gewerbesteuereinnahmen und dem Gemeindeanteil an der Einkommenssteuer.
2898	Even the asset balance defied forecasts again.	Even the accumulated assets had yet to decline much over the expected values.	Even the amount of the capital has risen again significantly over the forecast.	Auch der Vermögenshaushalt lag wieder deutlich über den geplanten Werten.
2899	He's stated that he had spent the intended amount of 1,5 million euros, but he was spending the same sum last year on it in excess of 2.5 millions euro.	His planned fund of 1,5 million euro was equivalent to 2,5 million euros last year.	In fact, he was putting up with the amount of one million euros planned to be paid in the past year by another 2.5 million euros.	Statt der vorgesehenen 1,5 Millionen Euro betrug er im vergangenen Jahr 2,5 Millionen Euro.
2900	Apparently that falls to the upper floor of the executive function, said Rothmund.	This is due to the higher level of executive pay, Rothmuth said.	This happens in the shape of the number, says Rothmund.	"""Dies liegt im Wesentlichen an der höheren Zuführung aus dem Verwaltungshaushalt"", so Rothmund."
2901	In fact, although more investment was done in the year 2012 than planned, the refund procedure was higher.	The fact that there were less investment plans than planned is why the litigation timetable is higher.	As spending was cut in 2012, less money was spent than expected, so the refunds are also higher.	Da im Haushaltsjahr 2012 weniger Investitionen als geplant getätigt worden sind, ist auch die Rücklagenzuführung höher ausgefallen.
2902	The total budget could be increased by about 1.2 million euros to all of the previous year's 48.5 million euro.	Overall, the aggregate cost of return could be increased by around 2,1 million euros to now total 4,9 million euros.	Total the refund was raised from around two million euros to around 4,000 euros.	Insgesamt konnte die allgemeine Rücklage um rund 2,1 Millionen Euro auf jetzt insgesamt 4,9 Millionen Euro gesteigert werden.

Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and their team for the good job.	Bürgermeister Ralph Gerster bedankte sich bei Rothmund und ihrem Team für die gute Arbeit.
2904	"The greek praised ""One can't just tamp up a work"", looked at the yearbook."	A work doesn't be shaken out by the wind, said Gerster with a glance at the year’s chart.	It's not easy to unravel such a work, said Gerster after looking at the year bill.	"""So ein Werk schüttelt man nicht einfach aus dem Ärmel"", lobte Gerster mit Blick auf die Jahresrechnung."
2905	He and the village clerks seem to be happy with the good figures.	He and the council members gleaned evidently from the good figures.	He and the parishioners appeared pleased with the good figures.	Er und die Gemeinderäte freuten sich sichtlich über die guten Zahlen.
2906	It's a paradox, but precisely these good numbers could soon prove expensive for the citizens.	It sounds paradoxical, but exactly these good figures could soon prove to be expensive for citizens.	It sounds paradoxical, but the precise figures that these people can expect will soon seem expensive.	Es mag paradox klingen, doch genau diese guten Zahlen könnten die Bürger bald teuer zu stehen kommen.
2907	The municipality was able to attract the population by having a good budget in the past.	The council was able to avoid high expenses through the good financial condition.	Due to the good finances, the community was able well to stave off high rents in the past.	Durch die gute Finanzlage konnte die Gemeinde in der Vergangenheit auf hohe Hebesätze verzichten.
2908	However, many of these people have been refused entry from their country.	However, more and more people have been putting their food down because of it.	Though many loud speakers are now being urged from the country.	Dadurch wiederum seien aber laut Gerster schon öfters Zuschüsse vom Land gekürzt worden.
2909	There are certain conditions that have to be met for this assemblage of whole-scale meals.	For this parcel of rice to be mixed up in different ways is necessary.	There are conditions for these soups made up of a variety of parts.	Für diese Zuschüsse aus diversen Ausgleichsstöcken gibt es Voraussetzungen.
2910	Among other things, the towns and localities that produce drinks have to demonstrate certain restrictions.	Under and above, the cities and towns which bean concessions must demonstrate certain covenants.	According to various statutes, the towns and townes who issue subsidies must submit specific exceptions.	Unter anderem müssen die Städte und Gemeinden, die Zuschüsse beantragen, bestimmte Hebesätze vorweisen.
2911	"We need to look at the topic of equity, because in the next year we will be investing in things which we would like to cash in on,"" said a senior executive in this respect."	The subject of policy sets us apart, as in the future years investments that we're keen on can be considered a non-starter, said a senior lawyer in this respect.	The subject of morals must be taken in consideration because in the coming years there are investments that we would like to take on board, one senior manager said.	"""Das Thema Hebesätze müssen wir uns anschauen, da in den kommenden Jahren Investitionen anstehen, für die wir gerne Zuschüsse hätten"", kündigte Gerster in diesem Zusammenhang an."
2912	Decorative jewellery: A great deal of young stones from the small men's shoulders demonstrate their faith in the firm.

2915	In the effect of the Firm shariath, the teenager said yes to her wedding and exhorted to the power of the Holy Spirit.	"When the Firm Sacrament was broken, the youths said ""to their graves and raised the Kraft of saintly lords""."	At the beginning of the Firm-Accession, the teenagers said no to their lives and exalt the power of the Holy Spirit.	Mit dem Empfang des Firmsakraments sagten die Jugendlichen Ja zu ihrer Taufe und erbaten die Kraft des Heiligen Geistes.

2921	The blockade policy did not excuse the website-propagation of Obamacare, and the use of steroids did not go against the law.	The ban on the website set out by Obamacare, and the Drohnen attack did not excuse the act.	The web hostility that Obamacare created did not excuse the site-wide charade and the holocaust attack.	Die Blockadepolitik entschuldige nicht die Website-Probleme von Obamacare, die Drohnenangriffe

2925	It's a book I believe will give me hope during my second year in medical school and give me another piece of hope.	It's a book that I believe would give me the chance to renew my medical school during the second semester.	It's a book I thought that would give me hope during my final year of medical school, to renew and provide me with new hope.	Es ist ein Buch, von dem ich geglaubt habe, es würde mich während des trübsinnigen zweiten Jahres meines Medizinstudiums aufheitern und mir wieder Hoffnung geben.

"Es heißt „The Audacity to Win"" (Mut zu gewinnen) und schildert die Memoiren Barack Obamas zur Präsidentschaftswahl 2008."
2927	If I finish my patient translations by the evening and go to bed, then this book returns in a time when the history of million was written and a speech was made.	If I finish my patient diary entries and go to bed in the evening, that book takes me back to a time when the philosophy of millions was being instilled and the making of speech the good news.	When I finish my patient-recorded manuscripts, and then go to bed, it will take me back in time when the topic of politics was discussed millions and a speech on the subject was completed.	Wenn ich abends mit meinen Patientenniederschriften fertig bin und zu Bett gehe, dann führt mich das Buch zurück in eine Zeit, als die Politik Millionen inspirierte und einem Reden den Atem rauben konnten.
2928	Election was roiling with an earthquake, and reporters held on to the news to bring the historical significance of this hour before their eyes.	Election was defeated in an earthquake and journalists were holding back to prevent the historical significance of this hour from being put in front of us.	Election resulted in a crash of the vote, and newspapers kept silent to warn about the significance of that hour.

When he first met Obama in 2008, his approval rating was 82 %.	Als damals 2008 Obama ins Amt wechselte, hatte er Zustimmungswerte von 82 %.
2932	And then I lay the book down.	Then I printed the book.	And then I closed the book.	Und dann schließe ich das Buch.
2933	To switch to another war is a bad wake as it is derived from a dream.	Resuming the debate is a wrong awakening, as if a dream was made.	Resuming the situation is a bad idea, as opposed to making up for a mistake.	Wieder umzuschalten auf die Gegenwart ist ein böses Erwachen, als ob man aus einem Traum gerissen wird.
2934	It's difficult to remember these optimistic times, a mere reminder appearing to be a frenzied memory of a sad reminder that there are no options.	It's hard to remember these optimist times. They seem to be a vague reminder, a sad reminder missed opportunities.	It's hard to remember these optimistic times — they seem to be a dull reminder, a sad reminder of the absence of any possible options.	Es fällt schwer, sich an diese optimistischen Zeiten zu erinnern – sie scheinen eine vage Erinnerung zu sein, eine traurige Mahnung an verpasste Möglichkeiten.
2935	The years since I first gave my voice, actually things have changed.	In the years since I gave my voice for the first time, there has actually been something changed.	In the years since I first gave my voice, a lot has changed.	In den Jahren, seit ich erstmals meine Stimme abgegeben habe, hat sich tatsächlich etwas verändert.
2936	But it's just not what I could have imagined.	But it's nothing at all I could have imagined.	But it is simply nothing I could have imagined.	Aber es ist einfach nichts, was ich mir hätte vorstellen können.
2937	I know the many and varied things Obama has accomplished, from the signing of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdraw from Iraq, the end of the alleged sexual abuse in the Armed Forces and the killing of Osama.	I recognize the many and varied things that Obama accomplished, from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal from the military from Iraq, the end of the escalation of gay marriage in the Armed Forces and the killing of Osama.	I recognize the great and varied things Obama has achieved, from the signing of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the widespread sexual exploitation of women in the army and the execution of Osama bin Laden.	Ich erkenne die großartigen und vielseitigen Dinge an, die Obama erreicht hat, von der Verabschiedung des Affordable Care Act für Krankenversicherung bis zum militärischen Abzug aus dem Irak, dem Ende des erzwungenen Verschweigens von Homosexualität in der Armee und der Tötung Osama bin Ladens.
2938	I think there were too many threats to government and the steps taken against us should be implemented: adoption of a law banning the prospect for public health insurance, and the closing of Guantanamo Bay only.	I also think that the parliamentary process has led to too many steps, which should be done in order to remove our nation from: reforms, policy overhaul, public option for health insurance and the ban on Guantanamo Bay just to name a few.	I too think that the policy of blockade in favour of our country should be amended: constitutional amendment, an open option for insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, but just a few of which I believe are necessary.	Auch ich bin der Ansicht, dass die parteipolitische Blockadetaktik zu viele Bestrebungen gekippt habe, mit denen unsere Nation vorwärts gebracht werden sollte: Einwanderungsreform, eine öffentliche Option für Krankenversicherung und das Schließen von Guantanamo Bay, um nur einige zu nennen.
2939	But after defending the Obama plan against colleagues and acquaintances, I ended my attempt at explaining.	Even though I have denied all the occasions that the Obama administration defended its colleagues and friends, I have finally succeeded in putting my explanations to bed.	But after I defended the Affordable Care Act in all three cases, I came to an agreement.	Doch nachdem ich zahllose Male die Obama-Regierung gegenüber Kollegen und Bekannten verteidigt habe, bin ich mit meinen Erklärungsversuchen am Ende angelangt.
2940	I reached a political cruciate crisis.	I reached a point of political regret.	I reached a political deadlock.	Ich habe einen Punkt politischer Verzweiflung erreicht.
2941	The republican blocade cannot explain why the adhering to espionage in foreign countries or the killing of innocent children by espionage can't be explained.	The republican blocade cannot explain the neglect of foreign presidential ties or the suicide of innocent children by bribes.	The restrictive policies in the Republic of Korea cannot be explained, such as the arresting of foreign parliamentarians or the abusing innocent children through begging.	Die republikanische Blockadepolitik kann nicht erklären, weshalb man das Abhören ausländischer Staatsoberhäupter zulässt oder die Tötung unschuldiger Kinder durch Drohnen in Übersee.
2942	It can't be explained why the National Security Agency gathers personal data of Americans, and why whistleblowers are encouraged to report offences against the state.	It is cannot be explained why the National Security Agency gathers personal data on Americans and why whistleblowers are advised of the state's misconduct.	It can't explain why the National Security Agency collects records about the lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are being urged to report such an offense.	Es kann nicht erklären, weshalb die National Security Agency Daten über das Privatleben von Amerikanern sammelt und warum Whistleblower bestraft werden, die staatliches Fehlverhalten offenlegen.
2943	It can't explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was killed without trial, nor can it explain why the public spending and expenditure limit are set during the presidential elections.	It is impossible to explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-American citizen, was killed without any procedures, nor how the public spending and expenditure limit would be changed during election campaigns.	Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, is not possible to explain why elections and the election of the president were halted without legislation, and the limits on public funding and expenditure are defensible in terms of presidential election.	Es kann nicht erklären, weshalb Anwar al-Awlaki, ein US-amerikanischer Staatsbürger, ohne Verfahren ermordet wurde, noch weshalb die öffentlichen Finanzierungs- und Ausgabegrenzen während der Präsidentschaftswahlen umgangen werden.
2944	"There isn't quite finished with the results of a report in which it says that the measures taken by the white house to improve the media are ""the most violent actions (...) since Nixon was elected""."	"The results of a report which has been called the ""most aggressive media policy"" since Nixon's administration are not sufficiently fulfilled."	"The result of a report, in which the White House's efforts to undermine the media were the most ""active... since Nixon took office"", is not fair enough."	"Es rechtfertigt nicht die Ergebnisse eines Berichts, in dem es heißt, die Anstrengungen des Weißen Hauses zur Ruhigstellung der Medien seien die „aggressivsten ... seit der Nixon-Regierung""."
2945	Not at all can it be excused in the more than three years since the repeal of the Affordable Care Act a simple website has been up for use.	Even the least bit of this annoyance can't be excused more than three years after the Affordable Care Act repealing a simple website.	Similarly, it's not easy to excuse the inability to post a simple website for more than three years since the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.	Und jüngstens kann es nicht die Unfähigkeit entschuldigen, in den mehr als drei Jahren seit der Verabschiedung des Affordable Care Act eine einfache Website zu entwerfen.
2946	I don't know if that is what I expected.	I don't know if this is what I should have expected.	I don't know if that's what I should have expected.	Ich weiß nicht, ob es das ist, was ich hätte erwarten sollen.
2947	I wonder whether or not I, now aged 18 years old, should have understood the work that you've been doing to advance their political campaign.	If I were 18, I should've understood that the government was working to raise awareness of her ambitious political campaign.	If I were at 18, I should've understood the way in which the government worked to promote their prior political campaigns.	Ob ich mit 18 hätte verstehen sollen, dass die Regierungsarbeit den ihr vorangehenden politischen Kampagnen widersprechen könnte.
2948	No doubt the decision-making process will not be unexpected, as the Newtown massacre precedes the public debate.	On the other hand, the abort tradition isn't in a pre-eminent course, since an opposition party and something as recent as the Newtown massacre preclude public discussion.	Obviously, the abstention has no precedent, as an opposition party and certain events such as the Newtown massacre are predisposing to public debate.	Offensichtlich ist das Abgeordnetenamt kein vorhersehbarer Kurs, da eine Oppositionspartei und zufällige Ereignisse wie das Newtown-Massaker die öffentliche Diskussion prägen.
2949	Rather than following the example above, they seem to be elected by the government themselves.	However, if I follow the above mentioned examples, they seem to be far from the government itself.	But if I refer to the above mentioned examples, they appear far from being actually elected by the government.	Doch wenn ich mir die oben genannten Beispiele ansehe, dann scheinen sie weitgehend von der Regierung selbst gewählt zu sein.
2950	That disturbs me most.	That's most concerning to me.	And I'm the least bit worried about this.	Und das stört mich am meisten.
2951	I was elected again in 2012, not because I was happy with his candidacy.	I elected Barack Obama again in 2012, not because of his candidacy.
